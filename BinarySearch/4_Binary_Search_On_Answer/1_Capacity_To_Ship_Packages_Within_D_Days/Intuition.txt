*   We need to ship all packages within 'days' days.
    Each day, ship has a fixed capacity.
    We must MINIMIZE this capacity.

*   Brute force trying all capacities is inefficient.

*   Key observation:
        If a capacity C is sufficient to ship within 'days',
        then any larger capacity is also sufficient.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (capacity).

*   Binary search range:

        Minimum capacity =
            max(weight in array)
        Reason:
            A ship must carry at least the heaviest package.

        Maximum capacity =
            sum of all weights
        Reason:
            Ship everything in one day.

*   For a candidate capacity C:
        Simulate shipping greedily day by day:

        - Add packages until capacity is exceeded
        - Start a new day when limit is crossed
        - Count total days used

*   Greedy simulation is optimal because:
        - Packages must be shipped in order
        - Filling each day as much as possible minimizes number of days

*   Feasibility check:

        - If required days > allowed days:
              capacity too small → increase capacity

        - If required days <= allowed days:
              capacity works → try smaller capacity

*   Binary search goal:
        Find the SMALLEST capacity such that
        all packages can be shipped within 'days'.

*   This works because:
        - Required days decreases monotonically as capacity increases
        - Greedy simulation gives minimum days for a fixed capacity

*   Time Complexity:
        Each feasibility check   → O(n)
        Binary search steps      → O(log(totalSum))

        Total → O(n log(totalSum))

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
