*   IN BST, we don't have to traverse entire tree. If a node data is smaller than both the target value, then
    LCA will always be in right subtree of that node.

*   Similarlly, If a node data is larger than both the target value, then
    LCA will always be in left subtree of that node.

*   based on above logic, traverse tree either to its left or right for searching. 

*   A node for which one of the target is smaller than that node and other is larger or vice versa, that node will be the
    LCA in BST so just return that node.
