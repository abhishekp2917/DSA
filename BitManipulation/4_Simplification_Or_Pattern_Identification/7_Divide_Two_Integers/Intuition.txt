*   The problem asks us to divide two integers without using multiplication,
    division, or modulo operators.

*   Direct subtraction would be too slow, so we look for a faster method based
    on binary representation.

*   Division can be viewed as repeated subtraction of the divisor from the
    dividend, scaled by powers of two.

*   To simplify calculations and avoid sign issues, both numbers are converted
    to their absolute values.

*   The final sign of the result is determined separately based on the original
    signs of the dividend and divisor.

*   The algorithm tries to subtract the largest possible multiple of the
    divisor from the dividend at each step.

*   This is done by left-shifting the divisor and checking if it still fits
    within the remaining dividend.

*   When a shifted divisor fits, it is subtracted and the corresponding power
    of two is added to the quotient.

*   This process is repeated from the highest bit to the lowest bit.

*   By iterating from bit 31 down to 0, we ensure that the largest contributions
    to the quotient are handled first.

*   The loop finishes when no more shifted divisors can be subtracted.

*   The accumulated value represents the absolute quotient.

*   A special edge case is handled where dividing the minimum integer by -1
    would overflow the integer range.

*   The algorithm runs in O(32) time, since it checks a fixed number of bits.

*   The space complexity is O(1), as only a few variables are used.
