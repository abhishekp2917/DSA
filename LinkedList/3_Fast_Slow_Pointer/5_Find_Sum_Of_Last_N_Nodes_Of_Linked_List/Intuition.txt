*   create two pointer viz slow and fast which will initially point to head of the LinkedList

*   move fast pointer N node ahead so that fast pointer will be ahead of slow pointer by N-1 node

*   now move both slow and fast node forward until fast node is null. By doing this
    slow pointer will point to Nth node from the last. As slow pointer points to Nth node from the last
    we just have to add all nodes value starting from slow pointer node

*   now create a temp variable to store last N nodes addition result and move slow pointer ahead until
    slow pointer is not null. While moving ahead add nodes value to temp variable and atlast return 
    that variable
