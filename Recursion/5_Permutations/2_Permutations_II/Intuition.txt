*   The problem asks for all unique permutations of an array that may
    contain duplicate elements.

*   Since order matters and all elements must be used, this is a
    permutation problem.

*   Duplicate values can lead to repeated permutations if not handled
    carefully.

*   In the first approach, sorting the array allows us to skip duplicate
    values when the previous identical element has not been used.

*   This ensures that duplicate numbers are chosen in a fixed relative
    order, preventing repeated permutations.

*   In the second approach, permutations are generated by fixing positions
    using swaps.

*   At each recursion level, a set is used to ensure that the same value
    is not placed multiple times at the same position.

*   Both approaches explore all valid permutations while pruning duplicate
    branches early.

*   Backtracking is used to restore state after exploring each choice.

*   The total number of unique permutations depends on the frequency of
    duplicate elements.
