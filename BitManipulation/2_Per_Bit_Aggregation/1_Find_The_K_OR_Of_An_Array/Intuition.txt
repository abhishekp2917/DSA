*   The problem defines K-OR as a bitwise operation where a bit is set if at least k numbers
    have that bit set at the same position.

*   Instead of combining numbers directly, each bit position is analyzed independently.

*   For every bit position from 0 to 30, we count how many numbers have that bit set.

*   This count is stored in an array where each index corresponds to a bit position.

*   If the count for a bit position is greater than or equal to k, that bit must be present
    in the final result.

*   Helper functions are used to:
    - Check whether a bit is set
    - Set a specific bit in the answer

*   After processing all bit positions, the constructed number is returned.

*   The algorithm runs in O(31 * n) time.

*   The space complexity is O(1) since the bit count array has fixed size.
