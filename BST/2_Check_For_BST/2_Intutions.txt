*   while traversing the tree, keep track of max and min value a subtree can have 

*   for left traveral, min value will be as it is and max value will become root node data minus 1. Similarly,
    for right traversal, max value will be as it is and min value will become root node data plus 1

*   for each node, if node data doesn't resides in the given range, then return false as that node violates the BST property

*   if both left and right subtree is BST then return true else false
