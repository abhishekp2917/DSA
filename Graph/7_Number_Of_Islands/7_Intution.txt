*   If we will start from a cell which is a land (i.e. value is 1), and do BFS/DFS traversal to it's neighbouring land 
    cell only, then we could visit all the land cells of that island.

*   Keeping above observation in mind, we can say that each time we start exploring from a new land cell, it means we 
    found a new island.

*   To make sure we don't start from a cell of previously visited island, we would mark cells as visited after traversing them. 

*   Iterate through each cell and whenever we found a non visited land cell, we would start the traversal from it and 
    then increment the counter after completion.

*   At last we would have counter which would reflect the number of island.
