*   Use queue for normal level order traversal. 

*   use stack to store each level nodes in it, so that while poping out the nodes from stack,
    the order will be from bottom to top.

*   while adding node in queue and stack first add right child node if exists then go for left 
    child because for each level while poping element from stack, the order in which it will
    pop out will be from left to right which is the required result.

*   Once stack holds all the nodes, pop out the elements from it and add it into final list
    which is to be returned.
