*   first store both the BST nodes separately in a list in increasing order.

*   since we want result in increasing order, keep a pointer of both the list

*   until any one of the pointer points outside the list, compare the element to which
    they are pointing to and whichever is teh smallest, add the elemtent into the answer
    list and increment that pointer by one

*   after coming out the loop, if any one of the list has some element left unexplored,
    add all those element in the answer list in the same order.
