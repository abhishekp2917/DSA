*   declare a function which will take node, two int values (x, y) and arraylist as a parameter

*   X and Y will be use to track horizontal and vertical position of a node. Intially, both 
    the values will be 0.

*   To store result, use ArrayList.

Intution for left view :

*   For getting left view, traverse the left node first then move to right node.   

*   Since we are traversing left side first, so the very first node that will be reached at 
    each level will be the part of the left view. 

*   So, if size of the list is less than the height of the tree, then only add the node in list
    cause that node wouldn't be added to the list 

*   after adding, first move left and then to right node.

Intution for right view :

*   For getting right view, traverse the right node first then move to left node.  

*   Since we are traversing right side first, so the very first node that will be reached at 
    each level will be the part of the right view. 

*   So, if size of the list is less than the height of the tree, then only add the node in list
    cause that node wouldn't be added to the list 

*   after adding, first move right and then to left node.
