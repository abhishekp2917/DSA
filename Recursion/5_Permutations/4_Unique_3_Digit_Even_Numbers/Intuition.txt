*   The task is to count how many unique 3-digit even numbers can be formed
    using the given digits.

*   Each digit can be used only as many times as it appears in the input.

*   A valid number must satisfy two conditions:
    it must be a 3-digit number (>= 100) and must be even.

*   The number is built digit by digit using backtracking.

*   At each step, we try all digits that are still available.

*   A frequency array is used to ensure digits are not reused more times
    than allowed.

*   Once three digits are placed, the constructed number is validated.

*   If the number is even and has no leading zero, it contributes to the count.

*   Backtracking ensures all valid permutations are explored without duplicates.

*   The search space is small, making brute-force generation feasible.
