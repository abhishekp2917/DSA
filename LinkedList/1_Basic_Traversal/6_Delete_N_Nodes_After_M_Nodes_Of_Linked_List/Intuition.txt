*   create a node viz tempHead whose next will be head. We are creating this node so that in case 
    we have to remove head, we will be able to do that using tempHead node.

*   create two pointer viz prev and curr which will be pointing to tempHead and head respectively.

*   while curr pointer is not pointing to null, move curr pointer by M + N node and prev node by M node 
    so that we can remove nodes between prev and curr pointer which is equal to N nodes.

*   finally return tempHead's next node.
