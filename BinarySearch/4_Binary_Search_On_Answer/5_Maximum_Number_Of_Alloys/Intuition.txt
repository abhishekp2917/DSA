*   We have k machines.
    Each machine defines how much metal of each type is needed to make 1 alloy.

*   We also have:
        - initial stock of each metal
        - cost per unit of each metal
        - total budget

*   Goal:
        Find the MAXIMUM number of alloys that can be produced
        using AT LEAST ONE machine and within budget.

*   Brute force trying all quantities is impossible.

*   Key observation:
        If we can produce X alloys,
        then we can also produce any smaller number.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (quantity).

*   Binary search range:

        Minimum = 0
        Reason:
            We can always make 0 alloys

        Maximum = very large (constraint based)
        Reason:
            Upper bound not tightly known, but safe limit used

*   For a candidate quantity Q:
        We check if ANY machine can produce Q alloys within budget.

*   Feasibility check for one machine:

        For each metal i:
            Required units = machine[i] * Q

            Already have = stock[i]

            Extra needed = max(0, required - stock[i])

            Cost for this metal = extra needed * cost[i]

        Total cost = sum over all metals

        If total cost <= budget → this machine works

*   Overall feasibility:
        If at least ONE machine can make Q alloys → Q is feasible

*   Binary search decisions:

        - If feasible:
              store Q and try larger quantity

        - If not feasible:
              try smaller quantity

*   This works because:
        - Required budget increases monotonically with quantity
        - At least one valid machine is sufficient
        - Cost calculation is exact using ceiling-free arithmetic

*   Time Complexity:
        For each binary search step:
            try all k machines
            each machine checks n metals

        Binary search steps → O(log(maxQuantity))

        Total → O(k * n * log(maxQuantity))

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
