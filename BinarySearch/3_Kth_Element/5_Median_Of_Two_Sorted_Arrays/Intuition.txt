*   We need to find the median of two sorted arrays in O(log(min(n, m))) time.

*   Median logic:
        If total length is odd:
              median = (total/2 + 1)-th smallest element

        If total length is even:
              median = average of (total/2)-th and (total/2 + 1)-th smallest

*   So the real problem becomes:
        Find the k-th smallest element in two sorted arrays.

*   Key idea:
        Partition both arrays such that:
            - Exactly k elements are on the LEFT side
            - All left elements <= all right elements

*   Suppose:
        We take cnt1 elements from nums1
        We take cnt2 = k - cnt1 elements from nums2

*   Valid partition condition:

        left1 <= right2   AND
        left2 <= right1

    Meaning:
        All left-side elements are <= all right-side elements

*   Binary search on cnt1 (how many we take from nums1)

        cnt1 range:
            max(0, k - n2)  to  min(k, n1)

*   At each step:

        - Compute cnt1 and cnt2
        - Check partition validity

        If valid:
              k-th smallest = max(left1, left2)

        If left1 > right2:
              Took too many from nums1 → move left

        If left2 > right1:
              Took too few from nums1 → move right

*   Why this works:

        - We always keep exactly k elements on the left side
        - Binary search finds the only partition where ordering is correct
        - Partition boundaries directly give the k-th element

*   Final median:
        If odd:
            return k-th element

        If even:
            return average of k-th and (k+1)-th elements

*   Time Complexity:
        Binary search on smaller array → O(log(min(n1, n2)))

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
