*   use start and end variable to track the first and last element of the queue at the ticket counter
    and a boolean value to keep track of the turn i.e. to remove from front or back

*   keep removing k elements from the queue (from front or back based on current turn) until queue size is less or equal 
    to k

*   for removing, if turn is to remove from front, then increment start value by k and for turn to remove from last, 
    decrement end by k

*   at last once queue size is less than or equal to k, we will have start and end of element of the queue, due to which
    if turn is from front, return end as end will be last removed if starting from front else return start as start will 
    be last to removed starting from last
