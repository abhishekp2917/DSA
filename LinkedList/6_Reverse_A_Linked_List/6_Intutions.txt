Intution to reverse a LinkedList 

*   create three pointers viz prev, curr and next which will point to null, head and null respectively.

*   while curr pointer is not pointing to null, make next pointer point to curr pointer's next node.
    we are keeping track of next pointer so that we can move curr pointer forward after certain operation on
    on curr pointer by making curr pointer to point next pointer.

*   thereafter, make curr pointer next node point to prev pointer. By doing so, we have changed the direction
    of LinkedList from curr pointer in reverse direction.

*   atlast make prev pointer point to curr pointer and curr pointer point to next pointer and will repeat the 
    same process until curr pointer points to null.

*   return prev pointer as it will point to head of the reversed LinkedList.
