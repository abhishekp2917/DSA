*   We need to select p DISJOINT pairs such that
    the MAXIMUM difference among chosen pairs is minimized.

*   Brute force choosing pairs is impossible due to combinations.

*   Key observation:
        If a maximum difference D is feasible,
        then any larger difference is also feasible.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (difference).

*   We sort the array because:
        - Closest values give smallest differences
        - Greedy pairing on adjacent elements becomes optimal

*   Binary search range:
        Minimum difference = 0
        Maximum difference = max(nums) - min(nums)

*   For a candidate difference D:
        We check how many disjoint pairs can be formed
        such that pair difference <= D.

*   Greedy pairing logic:

        Traverse from left to right:
            - Try to pair nums[i] with nums[i+1]
            - If their difference <= D:
                  form a pair and skip both elements
            - Else:
                  move forward to try next element

    Reason:
        Pairing closest available neighbors minimizes differences
        and maximizes the number of valid pairs.

*   Feasibility check:
        If number of formed pairs >= p → D is valid
        Else → D is too small

*   Binary search decisions:

        - If feasible:
              store D and try smaller difference

        - If not feasible:
              try larger difference

*   This works because:
        - Pair count decreases monotonically as D decreases
        - Greedy pairing always gives maximum number of pairs for a fixed D

*   Time Complexity:
        Sorting                  → O(n log n)
        Each feasibility check   → O(n)
        Binary search steps      → O(log(maxDiff))

        Total → O(n log n)

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
