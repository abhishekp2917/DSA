Intution to delete node from LinkedList without head pointer

*   here as we will get pointer to that node only which is to be deleted and that node will never 
    be the last node, next node of node to be deleted will never be null.

*   so, first replace the data of the given node (node to be deleted) with its next node, which will
    make two nodes of same data. So now we just have to remove one of the duplicate node. And as
    we can only access next node in LinkedList, we will remove give node next node from the list.

*   to do so, make give node next to point to given node next's next node
