Approach 1:

*   Alice wants to maximize the total stones she collects.

*   Bob also plays optimally, so Alice must assume Bob will always make
    the move that minimizes her future gain.

*   For every subarray [start, end], Alice has two choices:
    take the first pile or take the last pile.

*   After Alice makes a choice, Bob immediately responds optimally,
    which is why Alice assumes the minimum of the next possible states.

*   This creates a recursive structure where each state depends on
    smaller subproblems of the same type.

*   Memoization avoids recomputing the same subarrays repeatedly.

*   If Alice can collect more than half of the total stones, she wins.

Approach 2:

*   Instead of tracking Alice and Bob separately, we track the score
    difference between the current player and the opponent.

*   When a player takes a pile, they gain its stones immediately.

*   After that, the opponent plays optimally and reduces the advantage,
    which is why the recursive call is subtracted.

*   Each subarray [start, end] represents the same game in a smaller form.

*   The recursive function answers:
    “What is the best score difference the current player can guarantee?”

*   If Alice can guarantee a positive score difference at the start,
    she will end the game with more stones than Bob.
