*   Koko eats at a constant speed K (bananas per hour).
    Each hour she eats from only one pile.
    We need the MINIMUM speed such that all bananas are eaten within h hours.

*   Brute force checking all speeds is inefficient.

*   Key observation:
        If speed K is sufficient to finish within h hours,
        then any larger speed is also sufficient.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (speed).

*   Binary search range:

        Minimum speed = 1
        Reason:
            Koko must eat at least 1 banana per hour.

        Maximum speed = max(piles)
        Reason:
            Eating faster than the largest pile size is unnecessary.

*   For a candidate speed K:
        Compute how many hours are REQUIRED:

        For each pile with size p:
            Time needed = ceil(p / K)

    Reason:
        In one hour, Koko can eat at most K bananas from one pile,
        and partial piles still take a full hour.

*   Total hours = sum of all ceil(p / K)

*   Feasibility check:

        - If required hours > h:
              speed too slow → increase speed

        - If required hours <= h:
              speed works → try smaller speed

*   Binary search goal:
        Find the SMALLEST speed such that
        total hours required <= h.

*   This works because:
        - Required hours decreases monotonically as speed increases
        - Ceiling division correctly models per-pile time

*   Time Complexity:
        Each feasibility check   → O(n)
        Binary search steps      → O(log(maxPile))

        Total → O(n log(maxPile))

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
