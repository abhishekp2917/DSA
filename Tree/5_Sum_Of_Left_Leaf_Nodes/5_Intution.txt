*   The intution is to traverse the tree and aslo keep track of the node whether it's a left node or
    right node

*   while traversing left subtree, pass boolean value true indicating it's a left child and false 
    otherwise

*   once we reach the leaf node, check if it's a left child and add it's value to a gobal variable in 
    case it's a left child.
