*   To swap the leaf nodes we first have to find the pairs.

*   To find pair of leaf nodes, we will have a global ref which will hold the leaf node 

*   When we reach leaf node, we will check if global var is null or not

*   If global var is null that means current node is the first node of the leaf pair so just assign the 
    current node to that var

*   If global var is not null, that means current node is the pair of the global var, so swap their values and 
    make global var null as current leaf pairs are swapped
