*   since Linkedlist is given in ascending order, building tree in inorder fashion will result in BST

*   to make a balanced BST, while building the tree keep track of the size of current subtree. Left subtree 
    size will always be half of the current size and right subtree will have the other half minus root of the current subtree 

*   during recursion call, if the size goes below 0, return null
