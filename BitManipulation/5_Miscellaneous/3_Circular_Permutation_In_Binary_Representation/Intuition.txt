*   The problem asks us to generate a permutation of all n-bit binary numbers
    such that consecutive numbers differ by exactly one bit.

*   In addition, the permutation must be circular, meaning the last and first
    numbers should also differ by exactly one bit.

*   Gray codes naturally satisfy the condition where consecutive numbers differ
    by exactly one bit.

*   There are exactly 2^n Gray codes for n bits, and they form a circular
    sequence by definition.

*   A standard Gray code sequence can be generated using the formula
    gray = i ^ (i >> 1).

*   However, the sequence needs to start from a specific value provided as
    `start`.

*   To shift the sequence to start from `start`, we XOR every Gray code value
    with `start`.

*   XORing with the same value preserves the one-bit difference property
    between consecutive elements.

*   This transformation effectively rotates the Gray code sequence so that
    the first value becomes `start`.

*   The resulting sequence still maintains the circular property required
    by the problem.

*   Each transformed Gray code is added to the result list in order.

*   The algorithm avoids explicitly rotating the array and keeps the logic
    simple.

*   The time complexity is O(2^n), since each Gray code is generated once.

*   The space complexity is O(2^n), required to store the permutation.
