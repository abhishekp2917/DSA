*   traverse tree in reverse inorder fashion i.e. right -> root -> left

*   while traversing, keep track of sum of nodes that encountered

*   update the current node with the curr sum value and then add current node previous value to sum. To get the previous value of
    current node, before updating its value, temporarily store its value
