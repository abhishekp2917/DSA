*   if current node data is smaller than lower bound, then return the value which will be returned from current node right subtree
    because all the nodes of left subtree will be out of range. We will not return root here as we have to remove node which is out of range. 
    Instead we are returning whatever is getting returned from right subtree which will get assigned to parent node child

*   if current node data is larger than uppper bound, then return the value which will be returned from current node left subtree
    because all the nodes of right subtree will be out of range. We will not return root here as we have to remove node which is out of range. 
    Instead we are returning whatever is getting returned from left subtree which will get assigned to parent node child

*   if node is within the range, then reassign its left and right child node with the returned value that we will get from 
    traversing left and right subtree resp. At last return current node as it is within the range
