*   The problem states that every number appears exactly twice except one number that appears only once.

*   This hints at using a property that can "cancel out" duplicate values efficiently.

*   XOR is ideal here because XORing a number with itself results in 0, and XORing with 0 returns the number itself.

*   Start with an initial value of 0 and XOR every element of the array one by one.

*   When a number appears twice, the two XOR operations cancel each other out:
    (a ^ a = 0).

*   Because XOR is commutative and associative, the order of elements does not matter.

*   After processing the entire array, all duplicate numbers become 0.

*   The only number that remains is the one that appeared exactly once.

*   This approach avoids extra memory like hash maps and works in linear time.

*   The time complexity is O(n) since we traverse the array once.

*   The space complexity is O(1) because only a single variable is used.
