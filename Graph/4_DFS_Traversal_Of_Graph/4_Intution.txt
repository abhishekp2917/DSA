DFS Traversal of a Graph:

*   Imagine you're standing at a starting point in a maze.

*   From your current position, choose one of your connected neighbors and move to it.

*   From your new position, keep going deeper by moving to one of its connected neighbors, and so on. It's like walking 
    through the maze and never turning back until you're stuck.

*   Every time you visit a new place, mark it as visited, so you don’t go there again.

*   If you reach a place where there are no unvisited paths, you go back to the last place you visited, and check if 
    there's another unvisited path from there.

*   Keep repeating this process—going deeper into the maze and backtracking when needed—until you've visited all the places.
