*   The problem gives an encoded array where each value is
    the XOR of two consecutive elements of the original permutation.

*   The original array is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n,
    meaning all numbers appear exactly once.

*   XORing all numbers from 1 to n gives the XOR of the entire permutation.

*   XORing encoded elements at odd indices cancels out all elements
    except perm[0].

*   Using totalXor ^ oddIndexXor gives the first element of the permutation.

*   Once the first element is known, the rest of the permutation
    can be reconstructed sequentially.

*   Each next value is obtained by XORing the previous value
    with the corresponding encoded element.

*   This avoids using extra memory like sets or maps.

*   The solution works in linear time with constant extra space.

*   The time complexity is O(n).

*   The space complexity is O(1), excluding the output array.
