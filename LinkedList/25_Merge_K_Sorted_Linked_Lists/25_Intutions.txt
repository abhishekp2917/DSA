Intution to merge K sorted linked lists

*   create a PriorityQueue of Node and add head of all the LL in it.

*   create a Node viz tempHead to which all the node will be attached.

*   create a pointer viz ptr which will intially point to tempHead.

*   while size of PriorityQueue is not null, poll (smallest node) from it and make ptr next node to 
    this polled node. After attaching make the ptr equal to ptr next node

*   if polled node next pointer is not pointing to null, then add that next node to the PriorityQueue.

*   finally return the next pointer of temphead.
