*   For each node, get left and right subtree total sum values. 

*   temporarily store current node value and replace it with left and right subtree summation.

*   we need to return current subtree all the node sum which will be equal to left plus right plus 
    temp value (temp holds current root node value)

*   for the base condition, return 0 if root is null.
