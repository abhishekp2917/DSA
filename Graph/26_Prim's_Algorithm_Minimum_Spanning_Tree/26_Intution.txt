*   The intuition is to traverse the graph and keep adding the edge weights to the total cost until all nodes are visited.

*   To ensure the total cost is minimized, we always consider the edge with the lowest weight available at each step.

*   To efficiently select the minimum weight edge, we use a MinHeap (PriorityQueue) to store edges along with their weights.

*   If the polled node has not been visited, we add its edge weight to the total cost and push all its adjacent (neighboring) edges into the heap.

*   We repeat this process until all nodes are visited and the heap becomes empty.
