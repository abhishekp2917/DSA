*   The problem asks whether a string can be split into a sequence of numbers
    where each number (starting from the third) is the sum of the previous two.

*   The order of digits is fixed, so we cannot rearrange characters.

*   The main decision is where to split the string to form the next number.

*   Backtracking is used to try all possible prefixes as the next number in
    the sequence.

*   The first two numbers are chosen freely, but all subsequent numbers must
    satisfy the additive condition.

*   Pruning is applied to stop early when the current number exceeds the
    expected sum.

*   Leading zeros are handled by checking whether the parsed number matches
    the substring length.

*   If the entire string is consumed after forming at least three numbers,
    the sequence is valid.

*   This approach explores all valid ways to partition the string into an
    additive sequence.

*   The recursion depth is bounded by the length of the string, making the
    solution feasible with pruning.
