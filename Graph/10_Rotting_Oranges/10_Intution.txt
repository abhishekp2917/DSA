*   We will use BFS traversal and not the DFS traversal to rot the oranges because all the fresh oranges will be rotten 
    concurrently.

*   Since rottening of oranges will start from the rotten oranges, we will add all the rotten oranges to the queue 
    initially to start the BFS traversal.

*   Use a visited matrix to mark if an organge has been rotten.

*   Traverse only those neighbouring oranges which are fresh and not visited. If the orange is fresh and not visited then 
    mark it as visited and add it to the queue.

*   Increment the time after processing all the neighbours of the current oranges. If the queue is empty then it means 
    that all the oranges are rotten so we don't need to increment the time.

*   If all the oranges are rotten then return the time taken to rot all the oranges else return -1
