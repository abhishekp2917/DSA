*   build the clone tree and store each node from main tree in hashmap mapped to it cloned node

*   we are storing main node mapped to it's cloned node in map because, while assiging 
    the random ref of the cloned node, we can know what node to be assigned as a random node to cloned 
    node

*   to know what node to be pointed by random pointer, check what corresponding main node random pointer
    is pointing to and with that value, check for entry in hashmap to get it's cloned counterpart
