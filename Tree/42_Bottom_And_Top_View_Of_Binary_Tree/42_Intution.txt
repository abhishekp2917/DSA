bottom view :

*   The intution is to keep track of the vertical(y) and horizontal(x) co-ordinates of the nodes and
    store the node based on it's x co-ordinate in map where key will be x co-ordinate and value will 
    be node itself along with it's y co-ordinate (to select the deepest node of a particular x co-ordinate) 

*   While traversing, if doesn't have the node of a particular x co-ordinate then put the data inside the map

*   if data already exists, then compare the node's y co-ordinate with current node y co-ordinate and update
    the data if the current node is the deepest node 

*   while traversing the tree, maintain the leftmost and rightmost node co-ordinate because we have to store
    answer from left to right. If we have the leftmost and rightmost co-ordinate value, then we run a loop
    from left to right to store the data in required manner

top view :

*   the intution is similar to bottom view. The only difference is while inserting the node in the map, give preference
    to that node over other which is at upper level becuase we want top view
