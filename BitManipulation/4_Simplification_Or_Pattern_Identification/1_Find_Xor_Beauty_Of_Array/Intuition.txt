*   The problem defines XOR beauty as a value derived from XOR operations applied
    over elements of the array.

*   XOR has a key property where XORing a number with itself results in zero,
    and XORing with zero leaves the number unchanged.

*   XOR is also associative and commutative, meaning the order of operations
    does not affect the final result.

*   When multiple XOR expressions involving array elements are expanded, most
    intermediate values cancel out due to the self-canceling property of XOR.

*   After all cancellations, each number in the array contributes exactly once
    to the final XOR beauty value.

*   As a result, the XOR beauty is simply the XOR of all elements in the array.

*   This allows the solution to be implemented using a single pass through the
    array with an XOR accumulator.

*   No extra data structures or nested loops are required.

*   The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements.

*   The space complexity is O(1), since only one variable is used.
