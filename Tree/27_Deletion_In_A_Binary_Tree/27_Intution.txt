*   Traverse the tree in any fashion and find the node that needs to be removed and the deepest right node

*   To find the deepest right node, take a variable and update the variable with the current node while traversing so 
    when we come out of the traversal, the variable will have the deepest right node as it is the last node in the tree

*   once we have the both the above mentioned node ref, assign deepest right node value to the node that needs to be removed

*   Now remove the deepest right node. To do so, traverse the tree in any fashion and if for any node, the deepest right 
    node is it's child, make that node one of the child ref as null.
