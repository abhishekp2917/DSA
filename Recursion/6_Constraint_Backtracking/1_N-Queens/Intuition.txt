*   The problem asks us to place n queens on an n x n chessboard such that
    no two queens attack each other.

*   Exactly one queen must be placed in each row.

*   For a given row, the decision is which column to place the queen in.

*   Once a queen is placed, it restricts future choices by blocking its
    column and both diagonals.

*   Backtracking is used to try all valid column placements row by row.

*   If a queen placement causes a conflict, that branch is abandoned early.

*   When all rows are filled without conflicts, a valid board configuration
    is obtained.

*   The algorithm explores all permutations of column placements that satisfy
    the attack constraints.

*   The total number of solutions grows quickly with n, but pruning makes
    the search feasible.
