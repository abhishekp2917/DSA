*   Students take chalk in order, repeatedly in cycles.

*   Direct simulation may take too long because:
        k can be very large (up to 10^9)

*   Key observation:
        After one full round of students,
        chalk consumption repeats in the same pattern.

*   So first compute:
        totalChalkPerRound = sum of all chalk[i]

*   Instead of simulating many rounds,
    we only need to simulate:
        remainingChalk = k % totalChalkPerRound

*   Now the problem reduces to:
        In a single round, find the FIRST student
        whose cumulative chalk usage exceeds remainingChalk.

*   We build a prefix sum array:
        prefixSum[i] = chalk[0] + chalk[1] + ... + chalk[i]

*   We need the smallest index i such that:
        prefixSum[i] > remainingChalk

*   This is a classic:
        "first element greater than target" binary search problem

*   Binary search logic:
        - If prefixSum[mid] > remainingChalk → possible answer → move left
        - Else → this student can be served → move right

*   The first index where prefixSum > remainingChalk
    is the student who runs out of chalk.

*   This works because:
        - prefixSum is strictly increasing
        - cumulative usage is monotonic

*   Time Complexity:
        Prefix sum build      → O(n)
        Binary search         → O(log n)

        Total → O(n + log n)

*   Space Complexity:
        Prefix sum array → O(n)
