*   Set pointers to first and second node in linkedlist as slow and 
    fast pointer respectively

*   move the slow pointer by one node and fast pointer by two node 
    until next's next of fast node is null

*   while iterating (moving slow and fast pointer) if slow and fast pointer 
    points to same node then there is a loop present in linkedList

*   else loop doesn't exists
