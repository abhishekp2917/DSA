*   The problem asks for the minimum length subarray whose bitwise OR is greater than or equal to k.

*   Since bitwise OR only increases when more bits are added, we can use a sliding window approach.

*   We expand the window to the right until the OR value becomes greater than or equal to k.

*   Once the condition is satisfied, we try to shrink the window from the left to minimize its length.

*   To efficiently maintain the OR value while shrinking, we track how many numbers in the window contribute
    to each bit position.

*   For each number added to the window, we:
    - Update the count of set bits
    - Update the OR value

*   When removing a number from the left, we decrement the bit counts.

*   If the count of a bit becomes zero, that bit must be removed from the OR value.

*   This allows us to correctly maintain the OR value without recomputing it from scratch.

*   The window continues expanding and shrinking until all possibilities are explored.

*   If no subarray satisfies the condition, the answer remains -1.

*   The algorithm runs in O(30 * n) time.

*   The space complexity is O(1), since the bit count array has fixed size.
