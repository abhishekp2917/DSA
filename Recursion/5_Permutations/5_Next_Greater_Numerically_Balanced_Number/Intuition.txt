*   A numerically balanced number is one where digit i appears exactly i times
    in the number.

*   Since n is at most 10^6, only digits from 1 to 6 are relevant.

*   The idea is to generate valid candidate numbers by constructing them digit
    by digit using backtracking.

*   Each digit i has a limited quota of i uses, which is tracked using a count
    array.

*   At every step, we choose a digit whose remaining count is greater than zero
    and append it to the current number.

*   This creates a DFS over all possible digit arrangements that respect the
    allowed counts.

*   Whenever the constructed number exceeds n, we check whether the remaining
    counts satisfy the balanced condition.

*   If valid, we update the minimum answer found so far.

*   Pruning is applied by stopping recursion when the current number already
    exceeds the best known answer.

*   The search space is small due to strict digit limits, making brute-force
    backtracking feasible.
