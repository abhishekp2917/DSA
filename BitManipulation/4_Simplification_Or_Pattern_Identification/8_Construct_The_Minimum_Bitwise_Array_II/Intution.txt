*   The problem asks us to construct an array where each element is derived from
    the given number using specific bitwise rules.

*   Each number is processed independently, so the solution naturally uses a
    simple iteration over the list.

*   If a number is even, its least significant bit is zero, which violates the
    required condition for constructing a valid result.

*   In such cases, it is impossible to generate a valid value, so the answer
    for that number is set to -1.

*   When the number is odd, it has at least one trailing set bit, which allows
    controlled bit manipulation.

*   The expression (num + 1) is used to locate the lowest bit position where
    num has a zero.

*   Applying (num + 1) & (-(num + 1)) isolates the lowest set bit of (num + 1),
    which corresponds to the lowest clear bit in num.

*   To produce the minimum valid result, the bit just below this position is
    flipped using an XOR operation.

*   This operation preserves higher bits and changes the smallest possible bit,
    ensuring the result is minimal.

*   The process is repeated for each number in the input list.

*   All operations are constant time per element, making the solution efficient.

*   The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements.

*   The space complexity is O(n), due to the output array.
