*   Think of the problem as finding all unique combinations of numbers that add up to the target.

*   Each number can be used only once, and the array may contain duplicates — so we must avoid duplicate combinations like [1,2,2] appearing twice.

*   We begin by sorting the array — this helps:
        - Detect duplicates easily (as identical numbers appear together).
        - Stop recursion early when a number exceeds the remaining target.

*   The recursive function explores all subsets starting from currPtr, maintaining:

        - A current combination

        - The remaining target

        - A results list 

*   At every recursive step:

        - If the target becomes 0, we’ve found a valid combination → add it to results.

        - If the target becomes negative or we run out of numbers, stop exploring.

*   Inside the loop, we try each number from currPtr onward:

        - Skip duplicates: If the same number appeared just before (nums[i] == nums[i-1]) and we’re still in the same recursive level (i > currPtr), skip it. This ensures uniqueness of results.

        - Pick the number: Add it to the current combination.

        - Recurse ahead: Move to the next index (i + 1), since each number can be used only once.

        - Backtrack: Remove the number and try the next one.

*   The recursion explores all possible paths — pruning duplicates and impossible paths efficiently.
