Intution for Subtraction in Linked List

*   first remove the leading zeroes from both the LL by moving the head forward until node value is
    not zero.

*   find out which LL is greater in terms of decimal value.

    to do so check which LL length is greater. If bothe the LL have same size then compare there nodes 
    value and find out which LL has node value greater than the other at same place value.

*   after finding which LL has larger decimal value, reverse both the LL and create two pointer 
    ptr1 and ptr2 which will intially point to head of larger and smaller LL respectively.

    we are reversing both the LL because tail node holds once place and subtraction starts from 
    once place.
    
*   while ptr2 is not null, subtract ptr2 node value from ptr1 and move both the pointer forward. This 
    way we are subtracting smaller decimal number from the larger one. But there is a possibility that 
    some smaller LL nodes value would be larger than the larger LL node which will result in nodes
    having negative value in larger LL.

*   so remove negative nodes, add value 10 to each negative node and then subtract 1 from their next node.
    Perform this operation until all the nodes become postive.

*   finally reverse the larger LL and return its head.
