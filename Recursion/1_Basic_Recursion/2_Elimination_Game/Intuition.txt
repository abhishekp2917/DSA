*   The problem starts with numbers from 1 to n and repeatedly removes every
    second number, alternating the direction each round.

*   Instead of simulating removals, we focus on how the remaining numbers are
    transformed after each elimination round.

*   After one elimination round, exactly n/2 numbers remain, regardless of the
    direction.

*   These remaining numbers are not arbitrary; they are a transformed version
    of the original sequence.

*   When eliminating from the left, all odd positions are removed, and the
    remaining numbers are the even ones: 2, 4, 6, ...

*   This means each remaining number can be written as:
        original_value = 2 × new_index

*   Therefore, the result of the smaller problem (size n/2) must be multiplied
    by 2 to map back to the original numbering.

*   When eliminating from the right, the remaining numbers still form a sequence
    of size n/2, but the exact mapping depends on whether n is even or odd.

*   If n is even, the remaining numbers correspond to:
        original_value = 2 × new_index − 1

*   If n is odd, the remaining numbers correspond to:
        original_value = 2 × new_index

*   In all cases, each elimination round reduces the problem size to n/2 and
    transforms the result by a fixed factor and offset.

*   The direction flips after every round, so this transformation alternates
    accordingly.

*   The recursion continues until n becomes 1, which is the base case.

*   While returning from recursion, the result is reconstructed by applying
    the correct transformation at each level.

*   Since the problem size halves each time, the time complexity is O(log n),
    with recursion depth also O(log n).
