Intution to flatten a LinkedList

*   create a PriorityQueue of Node and add all the next node in it as all next node are head of the 
    bottom node.

*   create a Node viz tempHead to which all the node will be attached through bottom pointer

*   create a pointer viz ptr which will intially point to tempHead.

*   while size of PriorityQueue is not null, poll (smallest node) from it and make ptr next node to 
    this polled node. After attaching make the ptr equal to ptr next node

*   if polled node bottom pointer is not pointing to null, then add that bottom pointer node to the PriorityQueue.

*   finally return the bottom pointer of temphead.

*   this algo is simillar to merge K nodes in LinkedList
