*   traverse the tree and generate string representation of each subtree

*   use hashmap to store this string representation of subtree count.

*   while traversing check, if that subtree present in hashmap and has current count 
    equal to 1

*   if already presemt having count 1, increment the duplicate count by 1 else put that 
    string representation of subtree in hasmap with initial count of 1
