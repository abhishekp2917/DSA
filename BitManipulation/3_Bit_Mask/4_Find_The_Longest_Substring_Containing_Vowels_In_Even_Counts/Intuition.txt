*   The problem asks for the longest substring in which each vowel appears an
    even number of times.

*   A vowel appearing an even number of times means its parity is even, which
    can be tracked using bit manipulation.

*   Each vowel is represented by one bit, and the bit is toggled whenever that
    vowel is encountered.

*   A prefix XOR mask is used to represent the parity state of all vowels up to
    the current index.

*   If two prefixes have the same XOR mask, the substring between them has all
    vowels appearing an even number of times.

*   This is because the parity changes cancel out between the two positions.

*   A map is used to store the first index at which each XOR mask appears.

*   Storing the first occurrence ensures the longest possible substring is
    considered when the same mask is seen again.

*   The XOR mask is initialized to zero at index -1 to handle substrings that
    start at index 0.

*   While iterating through the string, the mask is updated only when a vowel is
    encountered.

*   If the current XOR mask has been seen before, the length of the substring
    between the two indices is computed.

*   The maximum such length found during iteration is stored as the answer.

*   Using XOR allows parity tracking in constant time per character.

*   The algorithm runs in O(n) time, since each character is processed once.

*   The space complexity is O(1), because there are only a fixed number of vowel
    parity states.
