Intution to intersect two sorted LinkedList

*   create a new Node viz ansHead which will be the head of the intersection of two sorted LinkedList
    and assign a pointer to it viz pointer 'curr'.

*   create two pointers viz ptr1 and ptr2 which will initially point to heads of both the sorted LinkedList.

*   move both pointer forward by one node until any one of them points to null.

*   compare both the pointer node data and whichever is smaller than the other make that node to 
    next of the curr pointer and move that pointer and curr pointer forward and make curr pointer next to null
    to break the connection with the given sorted LinkedList.

*   after coming out of the loop if any of the pointer is not null, then make that pointer to be the 
    next of curr pointer.

*   atlast return next node of ansHead.
