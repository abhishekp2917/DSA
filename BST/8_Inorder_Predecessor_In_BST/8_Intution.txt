*   we have to provide the node value which should be either smalller or equal to target. The intution is to keep updating our answer as we traverse the tree.

*   To find that, while traversing tree, if a node value is smaller than target, then assign that node value to answer variable 
    as that node could be our answer. After assigning, move right to explore further as it mak no sense to move left as all the values to the left
    will be smaller and we need closest value to target.

*   if a node value is greater than target, then neither of it's right subtree nor that node will have our answer. In this case, don't assign this node value.
    Instead, just move left to explore.
