*   traverse the tree in DFS fashion and return the total sum of nodes of current 
    subtree and number of subtree whose sum is equal to target

*   while backtracking, calculate the sum of current subtree with the help of 
    returned value from left and right subree  

*   if sum is equal to target, then return 1 + count from left and right subtree

*   if sum is not equal to target, then return count from left and right subtree
