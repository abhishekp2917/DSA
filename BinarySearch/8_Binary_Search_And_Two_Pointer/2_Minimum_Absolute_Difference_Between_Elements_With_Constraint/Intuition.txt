*   We need to minimize |nums[i] - nums[j]| with the constraint:
        |i - j| >= x

*   This means that when we are at index j,
    only indices i <= j - x are valid for comparison.

*   So we maintain a sliding window of VALID previous elements:
        - When j - i >= x, nums[i] becomes eligible to compare with nums[j]
        - We insert nums[i] into a data structure and then move i forward

*   To minimize absolute difference, for a given value nums[j],
    the closest candidates must be:
        - the largest value <= nums[j]   (floor)
        - the smallest value >= nums[j]  (ceil)

*   Therefore, we use a TreeSet because:
        - It keeps elements sorted
        - It supports floor() and ceiling() in O(log n)

*   For each valid nums[j]:
        - Find floor and ceil in the set
        - Compute both differences
        - Update the minimum answer

*   We slide the window forward by:
        - Adding nums[i] into the set when it becomes valid
        - Increasing i so that index gap condition is maintained

*   This works because:
        - Only valid indices are stored in the set
        - Closest neighbors in sorted order always give minimum difference

*   Time Complexity:
        Each insertion + floor + ceiling → O(log n)
        Done for all elements → O(n log n)

*   Space Complexity:
        TreeSet stores at most n elements → O(n)
