*   The problem asks whether a string of digits can be split into a Fibonacci
    sequence with at least three numbers.

*   The order of digits is fixed, so characters cannot be rearranged or skipped.

*   The main decision is where to split the string to form the next number.

*   Backtracking is used to try all possible prefix splits of the remaining
    string.

*   The first two numbers can be chosen freely, but all subsequent numbers
    must satisfy the Fibonacci condition.

*   Pruning is applied when the current number exceeds the expected sum of
    the previous two numbers.

*   Leading zeros are disallowed except for the number zero itself.

*   Integer overflow is avoided by stopping when numbers exceed Integer.MAX_VALUE.

*   When the entire string is consumed and the sequence length is at least 3,
    a valid Fibonacci sequence has been formed.

*   The recursion explores all valid cut positions efficiently due to pruning.
