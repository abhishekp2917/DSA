Intution to insert in sorted LinkedList

*   create two pointers viz prev and curr which will intially point to null and head of the given 
    LinkedList.

*   move both the prev and curr pointer until either curr pointer points to null or curr pointer data is larger
    than the value to be inserted so that we can reach to the node where we have to insert new node.

*   after coming out of the loop, if prev pointer points to null that means we need to add new node at the
    starting of the LinkedList. So, just create a new node and male its next to head of the given 
    LinkedList and then make that newly created node the head of the LinkedList

*   if prev is not null, then create a new node and make that node prev's next node. Thenafter, make
    newly created node next node to curr node so that we can add new node between prev and curr
    node

*   finally return head of the LinkedList
