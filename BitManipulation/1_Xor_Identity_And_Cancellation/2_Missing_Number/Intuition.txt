*   The array contains numbers in the range [0, n], but exactly one number is missing.

*   Since the numbers are supposed to be unique and cover a fixed range,
    we can compare what is expected with what is actually present.

*   XOR is useful because it cancels out duplicate values when applied twice.

*   First, XOR all numbers from 0 to n. This represents the complete expected set.

*   Then, XOR all numbers present in the array.

*   Every number that exists in both the expected range and the array
    cancels itself out.

*   The only number that does not cancel is the one that is missing
    from the array.

*   Because XOR is commutative and associative, the order of operations
    does not matter.

*   This approach avoids sorting or extra memory like hash sets.

*   The time complexity is O(n) since we iterate through the array once.

*   The space complexity is O(1) because only a single variable is used.
