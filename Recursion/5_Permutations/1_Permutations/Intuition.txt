*   The problem asks to generate all possible permutations of a given array.

*   A permutation is an arrangement where order matters, so [1,2,3] and [2,1,3]
    are considered different.

*   At each step, we decide which element should occupy the current position
    in the permutation.

*   In the first approach, we maintain a pool of remaining elements and choose
    one element at a time to build the permutation.

*   Once an element is chosen, it is temporarily removed so it cannot be reused
    at the same depth.

*   In the second approach, we fix elements at specific positions using swaps.

*   Each recursive call fixes one position and explores all valid choices for
    that position.

*   Backtracking ensures that after exploring one choice, the original state
    is restored before trying the next choice.

*   When all positions are fixed, a complete permutation is formed.

*   Both approaches explore all n! permutations, which is optimal for this task.

*   The recursion depth is O(n), and the total number of results is n!.
