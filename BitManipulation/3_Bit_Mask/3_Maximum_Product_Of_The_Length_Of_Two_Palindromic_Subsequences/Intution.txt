*   The problem asks us to find two palindromic subsequences that do not overlap
    and whose length product is as large as possible.

*   A subsequence can be represented by choosing or skipping each character,
    which naturally suggests a recursive backtracking approach.

*   While generating subsequences, a bitmask is used to record which indices of
    the original string are included.

*   This bitmask helps later to determine whether two subsequences overlap or
    not.

*   During recursion, whenever a non-empty subsequence is formed, it is checked
    to see if it is a palindrome.

*   If the subsequence is a palindrome, its length is stored in a map using the
    bitmask as the key.

*   The recursion explores both choices at each index: including the character
    or skipping it.

*   This ensures that all possible subsequences are considered.

*   After collecting all palindromic subsequences, the problem reduces to
    choosing two that do not overlap.

*   Two subsequences do not overlap if their bitmasks have no common set bits.

*   This condition is checked using a bitwise AND operation between masks.

*   For every valid pair of non-overlapping palindromes, the product of their
    lengths is computed.

*   The maximum product found across all valid pairs is stored as the answer.

*   Bitmask representation makes overlap detection efficient and simple.

*   Although the approach is exponential, it works because the input size is
    small.

*   The time complexity is O(2^n * n), due to subsequence generation and
    palindrome checks.

*   The space complexity is O(2^n), used to store palindromic subsequences.
