*   While traversing if curr node value is equal to target value, then return that node value

*   If curr node value is less than target value, then check on right subtree else check on left
    subtree.

*   while returning from curr node, if curr node is greater than target value, then just return 
    maximum of left and right subtree value 

*   If current node value is smaller than target value, then there is a possiblity of curr node
    value being the answer. So return maximum of left, right subtree an curr node value.
