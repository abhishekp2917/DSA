*   We are asked to find the integer square root of x,
    which means the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x.

*   The result must satisfy:
        result * result <= x
    and (result + 1) * (result + 1) > x

*   Instead of trying all numbers linearly, we can binary search on the
    possible answer range because the square function is monotonic
    (as the number increases, its square always increases).

*   The smallest possible square root is 1 and the largest possible is x / 2
    (for x >= 2), because any number greater than x / 2 squared will exceed x.

*   At each step, we pick a middle value mid as a candidate square root.

*   If mid * mid is less than or equal to x, then mid is a valid answer,
    but there might exist a larger valid value.
    So we store mid as a possible result and search on the right side.

*   If mid * mid is greater than x, then mid is too large to be the square root,
    so we discard the right side and search on the left side.

*   We always keep track of the largest valid mid found so far.

*   When the search finishes, the stored value is the floor of sqrt(x).

*   This works because the condition (mid * mid <= x) is monotonic:
    once it becomes false, it will remain false for all larger values.

*   Time Complexity  : O(log x) because we binary search on the value range.

*   Space Complexity : O(1) because only constant extra variables are used.
