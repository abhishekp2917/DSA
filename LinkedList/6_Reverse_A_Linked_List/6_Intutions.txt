Intution to add node in the middle of the LinkedList 

*   create a pointer viz. curr which will intially points to head of the LinkedList

*   while curr pointer is pointing to a node whose next node is not null, make curr pointer node's 
    next reference to curr pointer node's next's next node. After that move curr pointer to next node
    (after removing next node, curr pointer will move to next's next node) 

*   by doing so we are removing node between curr pointer node and next's next node
