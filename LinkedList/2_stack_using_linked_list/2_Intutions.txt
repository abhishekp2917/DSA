(1) Intution to push element to top of the stack using LinkedList :

*   we will maintain top of stack using head of linked list.

*   for a new value, create a new node and make its next point to current head.

*   make the head ptr point to newly created node. This way head will always point to last input value (top of stack)

(2) Intution to pop element from top of the stack using LinkedList :

*   if head is null then return -1

*   else make the head pointer point to its next so as to eliminate the head (top of stack)
