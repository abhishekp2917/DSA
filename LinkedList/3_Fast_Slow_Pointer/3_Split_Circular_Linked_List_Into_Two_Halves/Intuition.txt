*   create two variables viz head1 and head2 to store head of the two half circular LinkedList

*   find the middle of the circular LinkedList by taking head of the list instead of 
    null as a reference for the fast pointer

*   once we reach at the middle node, assign middle node's next node to head2 and then
    make middle node next to be null to break the list

*   find the last node of the circular LinkedList while staring from the head2. Once we
    reach at last node make its next to be head2 to make the LinkedList circular.

*   now assign head to head1 and make middle node next to be head1 as middle node is last node 
    of head1 and to make first LinkedList circular, we have to connect last node with first node
