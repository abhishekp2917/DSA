*   The intution is to maintain a linkedlist which will have the key-value pair as a node value. This linkedlist will 
    imitate as a cache.

*   for inserting new value, check the size of linkedlist. If it exceeds the limit, then remove the last node from the 
    linkedlist. After checking, insert the new node in front of the linkedlist.

*   for inserting an existing one which already there in linkedlist, don't check the size, just remove that node from its 
    position and add it to the front of the linkedlist.

*   for getting the key, again remove that node from it's position if it's present and add to the front of the linkedlist
    and then return that node value. If it's not present, then return -1.

*   to make node search in linkedlist in O(1), use map where key value will be key of that node and value will be ref of 
    that node.
