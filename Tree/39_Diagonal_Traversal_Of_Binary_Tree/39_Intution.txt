*   while traversing the tree, keep track of the vertical and horizontal position (co-ordinates) of 
    the nodes

*   the absolute diff of their vertical and horizontal position will give the diagonal level of the node

*   maintain a hashmap of diagonal level and it's associated nodes in form of list

*   after completion of traversal, add each level nodes in the answer list starting from the zeroth level
