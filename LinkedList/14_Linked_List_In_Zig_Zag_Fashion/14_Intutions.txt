Intution to make LinkedList in zig-zag fashion

*   create a node viz tempHead whose next will be head so that prev node will not be null at initially

*   create three pointer viz prev, curr and next which will initially point to tempHead, head and head's next
    node of the LinkedList

*   create a boolean variable viz status to track whether two nodes relation should be lessthan or greaterthan so that
    we based on the situation we can perform certain operation

*   while next pointer is not null, move prev, curr and next pointer and check whether curr nodes data
    and next node data relation is equal to required relation or not. If it is not equal to
    required realtion then just swap those node postion else leave as it is.

*   now toggle the boolean variable so that we can switch from lessthan to greaterthan or viceversa and
    move all the pointers forward 

*   finally return the tempHead next node
