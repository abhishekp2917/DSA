*   The intution is to use two stack to traverse BST in DFS fashion. 

*   First will add all the left nodes ion both the stack viz stack1 and stack2 of root1 and root2 resp.

*   After this compare top element of both the stack, if they are the same then add the element 
    in the result list and then pop out the top element from both the stack and add all the left
    nodes of that poped element right node

*   If top element aren't the same, then pop out the smallest element from its stack and 
    add all the left nodes of that poped element right node

*   By doing so, the element in the stack will be in ascending order from top to bottom in both the stack

*   This will become similar to searching common elements in two sorted array
