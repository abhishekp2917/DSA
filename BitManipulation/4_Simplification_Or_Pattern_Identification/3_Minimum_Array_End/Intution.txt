*   The problem asks us to compute the minimum possible value of the last element
    after constructing an array of length n, starting with the value x.

*   The key constraint is that the bitwise AND of consecutive elements must
    remain equal to x.

*   This implies that all bits set in x must remain set in every element of the
    array.

*   Therefore, when constructing the last element, we are only allowed to
    modify bit positions where x has a zero.

*   The idea is to encode the value (n - 1) into the zero-bit positions of x.

*   Each bit of (n - 1) is placed into the next available zero bit position of
    the answer.

*   This guarantees that the resulting value is the smallest possible while
    still satisfying the constraints.

*   We process the bits of (n - 1) from least significant to most significant.

*   For each bit, we scan forward to find the next zero bit position in the
    current answer.

*   That bit from (n - 1) is inserted into this position.

*   After placing a bit, we move forward to look for the next zero bit position.

*   This process continues until all bits of (n - 1) have been placed.

*   The final constructed number is returned as the minimum possible ending
    value.

*   The algorithm runs in O(number of bits) time.

*   The space complexity is O(1), since only a few variables are used.
