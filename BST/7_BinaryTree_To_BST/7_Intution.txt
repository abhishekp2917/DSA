*   The inorder traversal of BST gives elements in sorted order. Keeping this in mind, 
    we will first find all the elements of given binary tree and will sort it in ascending order

*   after getting sorted list of elements, just update the tree node by traversing it in inorder
    fashion

*   to keep track of index of element to be inserted, declare a global variable and increment it by 1 on each
    updation of node
