*   The problem asks us to find all numbers that appear in at least two of the
    three given arrays.

*   Since each number can appear in any combination of the three arrays, we
    need a way to track presence across multiple sources.

*   Bit masking is a natural fit because each array can be represented by one
    bit position.

*   We use a map where each number is mapped to an integer mask that represents
    which arrays contain that number.

*   When a number appears in the first array, we set bit 0 in its mask.

*   When it appears in the second array, we set bit 1 in its mask.

*   When it appears in the third array, we set bit 2 in its mask.

*   Using bitwise OR ensures that repeated appearances in the same array do not
    affect the mask.

*   After processing all three arrays, each number’s mask encodes its presence
    across the arrays.

*   To decide if a number appears in at least two arrays, we count how many bits
    are set in its mask.

*   If the number of set bits is greater than or equal to two, the number is
    included in the result.

*   This avoids checking array intersections explicitly and keeps the logic
    clean and efficient.

*   The time complexity is O(n1 + n2 + n3), where n1, n2, and n3 are the array
    lengths.

*   The space complexity is O(n), used by the map to store unique numbers.
