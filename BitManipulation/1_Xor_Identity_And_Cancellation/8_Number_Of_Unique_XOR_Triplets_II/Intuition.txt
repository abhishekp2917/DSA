*   The problem asks for the number of distinct values that can be formed
    by XORing any three elements from the array.

*   Instead of choosing three indices directly, we observe that:
    (a ^ b ^ c) can be rewritten as (a ^ b) ^ c.

*   This allows us to break the problem into two stages.

*   First, compute all possible XOR values formed by XORing
    any two elements of the array.

*   These values are stored in a boolean array representing
    the entire possible XOR value space.

*   The XOR result space is bounded because all values are
    less than 2^11.

*   Next, iterate through every possible XOR result value
    and check if it can be produced by XORing:
    (some pair XOR) with a third number from the array.

*   If such a combination exists, that XOR result is valid
    and counted exactly once.

*   Using a boolean array avoids counting duplicates.

*   This approach avoids explicitly iterating over all triplets,
    while still following the same logical computation.

*   The time complexity comes from generating all pair XORs
    and checking each possible XOR value.

*   The space complexity is fixed and depends only on
    the maximum possible XOR value.
