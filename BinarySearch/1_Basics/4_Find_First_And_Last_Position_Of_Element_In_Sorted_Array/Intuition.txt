*   The array is sorted, so all occurrences of the target appear in a contiguous block.
    This allows us to use Binary Search instead of scanning linearly.

*   We need to find two things:
        - the first (leftmost) index of target
        - the last  (rightmost) index of target

*   We run binary search TWICE:
        - First search → push towards the LEFT to find earliest position
        - Second search → push towards the RIGHT to find latest position

*   In the first search:
        - If nums[mid] >= target, the first occurrence must be on the LEFT side.
        - If nums[mid] == target, we store mid as a possible answer,
          but continue searching left to find an earlier one.

*   This guarantees that we finally land on the LEFTMOST occurrence.

*   In the second search:
        - If nums[mid] > target, the last occurrence must be on the LEFT side.
        - If nums[mid] <= target, the last occurrence can be at mid or on the RIGHT side.
        - If nums[mid] == target, we store mid and continue searching right.

*   This guarantees that we finally land on the RIGHTMOST occurrence.

*   Using two binary searches works because:
        - All target values are grouped together in a sorted array.
        - Binary search can precisely locate the boundaries of that group.

*   If the target does not exist, both values remain -1.

*   Time Complexity  : O(log n) because we perform two binary searches.

*   Space Complexity : O(1) because only constant extra variables are used.
