*   The array is originally sorted but rotated at an unknown pivot.

*   We must find target in O(log n), so linear search is not allowed.

*   Key observation:
        At any index mid, ONE of the two halves is always SORTED.

*   We use modified binary search:
        - At every step, identify which half is sorted
        - Check whether target lies inside that sorted half
        - Discard the other half

*   How to detect sorted half:

        If nums[mid] >= nums[0] AND nums[mid] > nums[last]:
            mid lies in LEFT SORTED PART

        Else:
            mid lies in RIGHT SORTED PART

    Reason:
        After rotation:
            Left part contains values >= nums[0]
            Right part contains values <= nums[last]

*   If mid is in LEFT sorted part:

        Sorted range = [nums[0] ... nums[mid]

        If target lies inside this range:
              search LEFT
        Else:
              search RIGHT

*   If mid is in RIGHT sorted part:

        Sorted range = nums[mid] ... nums[last]]

        If target lies inside this range:
              search RIGHT
        Else:
              search LEFT

*   This works because:
        - One side is always sorted
        - We can always decide which half can safely be discarded

*   Time Complexity:
        O(log n)

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
