Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-into-the-max-number-of-unique-substrings/description

*   The problem asks us to split a string into substrings such that all
    substrings are unique.

*   The order of characters is fixed, so we are not rearranging the string.

*   The only decision at each step is where to cut the string.

*   Starting from a given index, we try all possible substrings that begin at
    that index.

*   A substring can be chosen only if it has not appeared earlier in the split.

*   Once a valid substring is chosen, we recursively solve the problem for the
    remaining suffix.

*   A set is used to track which substrings have already been used.

*   When the end of the string is reached, the size of the set represents the
    number of unique substrings formed.

*   Among all possible ways to split the string, we choose the one that
    maximizes the count of unique substrings.

*   Backtracking is used to explore all valid cut positions and undo choices.

*   The time complexity is exponential due to the number of possible partitions.

*   The space complexity is O(n) due to recursion depth and stored substrings.
