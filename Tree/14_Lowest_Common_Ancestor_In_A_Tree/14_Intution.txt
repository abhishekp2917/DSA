*   The logic here is that traverse left and right subtree and when we find a node that is 
    the one of the given node then return that node else return from left and right traversal 
    which is not null.

*   on doing this, at one point when from both left and right traversal we will get node (non null value).
    And that node for which we get two node returned from left and right traversal is LCA
