*   For each element in arr1, we need to check whether there exists any element in arr2
    such that |arr1[i] - arr2[j]| <= d.

*   Instead of comparing with every element in arr2 (O(n*m)),
    we sort arr2 and use Binary Search to find the closest values efficiently.

*   After sorting, the closest elements to any number must be:
        - the largest value <= num   (lower bound)
        - the smallest value >= num  (upper bound)

*   If both of these closest values are farther than distance d,
    then no element in arr2 lies within distance d from num.

*   So for each num in arr1:
        - Find lower bound in arr2 (floor value)
        - Find upper bound in arr2 (ceil value)
        - Check both distances

*   If:
        |lowerBound - num| > d   AND
        |upperBound - num| > d
    then this num is valid and we increase the count.

*   Lower Bound logic:
        - Find the greatest element that is <= target
        - Move right when value is valid to get as close as possible

*   Upper Bound logic:
        - Find the smallest element that is >= target
        - Move left when value is valid to get as close as possible

*   This works because in a sorted array, the closest element to any number
    must be either the immediate smaller or immediate larger value.

*   Time Complexity:
        Sorting arr2        → O(m log m)
        For each arr1[i]    → 2 binary searches → O(log m)
        Total              → O(m log m + n log m)

*   Space Complexity : O(1) extra space (ignoring sort space)
