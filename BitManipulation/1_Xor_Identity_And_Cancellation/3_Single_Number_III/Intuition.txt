*   The problem states that exactly two numbers appear once,
    while all other numbers appear exactly twice.

*   XOR is useful because duplicate numbers cancel each other out.

*   When all numbers are XORed together, the result is:
    xorAll = a ^ b, where a and b are the two unique numbers.

*   Since a and b are different, xorAll must contain at least
    one set bit.

*   A set bit in xorAll means that a and b differ at that bit position.

*   By isolating the lowest set bit using (xorAll & -xorAll),
    we get a bit that separates a and b into different groups.

*   Now, partition all numbers into two groups:
    - Numbers where this bit is set
    - Numbers where this bit is not set

*   All duplicate numbers fall into the same group and cancel out.

*   Each group is left with exactly one unique number.

*   This avoids extra memory like hash maps and works in linear time.

*   The time complexity is O(n) since the array is scanned twice.

*   The space complexity is O(1) because only constant extra variables are used.
