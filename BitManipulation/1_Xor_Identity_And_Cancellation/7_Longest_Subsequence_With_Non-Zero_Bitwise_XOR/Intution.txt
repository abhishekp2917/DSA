*   The goal is to find the longest subsequence whose XOR value is non-zero.

*   XOR becomes zero only when all contributing values cancel each other out.

*   First, compute the XOR of the entire array.

*   If this XOR is non-zero, then taking all elements already satisfies
    the condition, so the answer is the full length of the array.

*   If the XOR of the entire array is zero, it means all elements together
    cancel out perfectly.

*   In this case, removing any single element will break the cancellation
    and result in a non-zero XOR.

*   Therefore, the longest possible subsequence in this case is
    the array length minus one.

*   There is no need to check individual subsequences explicitly.

*   This works because XOR is associative and removing one element
    changes the overall XOR result.

*   The time complexity is O(n) since we scan the array once.

*   The space complexity is O(1) because only a single variable is used.
