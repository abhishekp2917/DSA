*   Two words are considered similar if they contain exactly the same set of
    characters, regardless of order or frequency.

*   Since the words contain only lowercase English letters, each character can
    be represented using a single bit.

*   A bitmask is used where each bit corresponds to one character from 'a' to
    'z'.

*   For every word, we iterate through its characters and set the corresponding
    bit in the mask.

*   If a character appears multiple times in a word, the same bit is set again,
    which does not change the mask.

*   After processing a word, its bitmask fully represents the set of characters
    present in that word.

*   Once all words are converted into bitmasks, the problem reduces to counting
    how many pairs of masks are identical.

*   To compare two masks, XOR is used because identical masks produce a result
    of zero when XORed.

*   If the XOR of two masks is zero, the corresponding words are similar.

*   All pairs of words are checked using two nested loops to ensure every
    possible pair is considered.

*   Each time a similar pair is found, the count is incremented.

*   At the end of the iteration, the total count represents the number of
    similar word pairs.

*   The time complexity is O(n² + totalCharacters), due to pair comparison and
    mask construction.

*   The space complexity is O(n), used for storing the bitmask of each word.
