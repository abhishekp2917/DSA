*   Two players take turns playing with a number n.

*   On each turn, a player chooses a divisor x of n such that 0 < x < n,
    and replaces n with n - x.

*   If a player cannot make a move (n becomes 1), that player loses.

*   The game is deterministic and both players play optimally.

*   The key idea is to determine whether the current player can force
    the opponent into a losing position.

*   For a given n, the current player tries all valid divisors.

*   If there exists at least one divisor i such that the opponent loses
    when the game continues with (n - i), then the current player wins.

*   If all valid moves lead to states where the opponent can win,
    then the current player loses.

*   This creates a recursive structure where the result for n depends
    on smaller values of n.

*   Memoization is used to avoid recomputing the same game states,
    making the solution efficient.
