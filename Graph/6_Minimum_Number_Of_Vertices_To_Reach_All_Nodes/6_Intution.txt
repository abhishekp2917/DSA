*   The smallest set of nodes includes only those that have no incoming edges (i.e., no parent nodes).

*   In the directed graph, the edge (a -> b) shows 'b' can be reached from 'a', where 'a' is parent node and 'b' being 
    its child.

*   So if we iterate through all the edges (a -> b) given to us and mark 'b' as child, then whichever node left after
    marking would be the node which doesn't have a parent.

*   That means, the set of remaining node would be the smallest set of nodes that we need to traverse all the nodes.
