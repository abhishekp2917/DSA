*   The grid is represented as a 2D matrix where each cell can either be water (0) or land (1). 

*   The goal is to track how many distinct "islands" (connected components of land) are formed as we add land one by one provided by operators array.

*   We use the DSU structure to keep track of connected components (islands). 

*   Each cell initially represents its own island, and as we add land, we try to merge islands that become connected.

*   When a new land cell is added, we check its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). If any of the neighbors are already land, we try to merge the two islands. 

*   Merging reduces the total count of islands by 1 as two island will merge into one.

*   When finding the root of a component, we use path compression to flatten the tree structure, ensuring future find operations are faster.

*   After each land addition, we update the number of distinct islands and store it in the result list.
