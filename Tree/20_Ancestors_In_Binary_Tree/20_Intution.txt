*   The intution is while traversing, if we find the target node then return an empty arraylist else
    return null.

*   By doing this, while backtracking if any of the subtree returns arraylist that means current node
    is one of the ancestor of the target node. So simply add that node in arraylist and return that 
    arraylist after modification.

*   This will add up ancestors of target node from bottom to top and finally the function will return 
    the required result
