*   The problem asks for the k-th permutation of numbers from 1 to n in
    lexicographical order.

*   Generating all permutations would take O(n!) time, which is unnecessary.

*   The key observation is that permutations can be grouped based on the
    first digit.

*   For n numbers, fixing the first digit creates (n-1)! permutations.

*   By dividing k by (n-1)!, we can determine which digit should appear
    at the current position.

*   Once a digit is fixed, it is removed from the available pool.

*   The same logic is applied recursively to determine the remaining digits.

*   This approach is based on the factorial number system.

*   The recursion builds the permutation one digit at a time without
    generating all permutations.

*   Time complexity is O(n^2) due to list removals, and space complexity
    is O(n).
