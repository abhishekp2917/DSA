*   The problem asks for the XOR of elements in multiple subarrays.

*   Calculating XOR for each query by looping every time would be inefficient.

*   XOR has a useful property similar to prefix sums:
    prefixXor[i] stores the XOR of elements from index 0 to i.

*   Using prefix XOR allows reuse of previous computations.

*   The XOR of a subarray [L, R] can be computed as:
    prefixXor[R] ^ prefixXor[L - 1].

*   This works because values before index L cancel out due to
    XOR’s self-canceling property.

*   If L is 0, then the XOR is simply prefixXor[R].

*   After building the prefix XOR array once, each query
    can be answered in constant time.

*   This reduces the overall time complexity significantly.

*   The prefix array is built in O(n) time,
    and answering all queries takes O(q) time.

*   The space complexity is O(n) due to the prefix XOR array.
