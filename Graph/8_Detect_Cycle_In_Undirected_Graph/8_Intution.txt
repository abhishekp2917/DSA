*   In an undirected graph, a cycle exists if we encounter a node that we have already visited.

*   To detect cycles, we traverse the graph while keeping track of visited nodes.

*   If we reach a previously visited node (excluding the direct parent), a cycle is present.

*   Since the graph may have multiple connected components, we start traversal from each unvisited node.
