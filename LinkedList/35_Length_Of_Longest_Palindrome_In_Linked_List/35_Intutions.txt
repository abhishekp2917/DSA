Intution to find length of longest palindrome in linked list

*   create two pointer viz ptr1 and ptr2 which will initially point to head and head's next node.

*   while ptr2 is not pointing to null, split the LL from ptr1 and ptr2 and store these two splitted 
    LL in variable viz LL1 and LL2 where LL1 will point to head and LL2 will point to ptr2
    as ptr2 is starting node for second part of LL and ptr1 is tail of first part of LL.

*   reverse the first part of the LL and store its had in LL1.

*   compare both LL1 and LL2 and count the how many nodes are simillar from the starting.

    this is done for palindrome having even length

*   simillarly, compare both LL1 and LL2's next and count the how many nodes are simillar 
    from the starting.

    this is done for palindrome having odd length.

*   maintain a global variable viz maxlength and update this variable in each iteration with
    maximum value from both of above comapre values.

*   finally return maxLength.
