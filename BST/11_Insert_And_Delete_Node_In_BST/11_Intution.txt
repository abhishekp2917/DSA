Add a new node :

*   To add a new node, if node value is smaller than target node, then traverse right else traverse left.

*   On each left or right traversal, reassign the left or right child resp with node returned from the traversal.

*   By doing so, we will reach the node which is null, in that case just create a new node and return it. That retured node will get assigned
    as a child of its parent node

*   Atlast, return the parent node.

Delete a node :

*   search for the target node

*   Once found the node, check if that node has both the child or not.

*   If both the child exist then attach right child to rightmost child of left child and return left child. This way it will not lose BST property

*   If only one child is present, then return that child.

*   Since we are returning the node, parent node will reassign left or right child with that returned value. In case the node is not target node
    we will return that node only, so that that node will not get removed.
