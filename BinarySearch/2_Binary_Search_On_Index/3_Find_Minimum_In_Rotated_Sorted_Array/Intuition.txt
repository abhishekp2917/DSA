Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/

*   The array is originally sorted and then rotated at some pivot.

*   We need to find the MINIMUM element in O(log n).

*   Key observation:
        The array consists of two parts:
            - Left sorted part (values >= nums[0])
            - Right rotated part (values <= nums[last])

        The MINIMUM element always lies in the RIGHT rotated part.

*   At any mid position, we determine which part mid belongs to.

*   How to detect the region of mid:

        If nums[mid] >= nums[0] AND nums[mid] >= nums[last]:
              mid is in LEFT sorted part

        Else:
              mid is in RIGHT rotated part

*   If mid is in LEFT sorted part:

        - All values from i to mid are >= nums[0]
        - Minimum cannot be there
        - So we move RIGHT → i = mid + 1

*   If mid is in RIGHT rotated part:

        - This region contains the pivot and minimum
        - nums[mid] is a valid candidate for minimum
        - But there may be smaller values on the LEFT side
        - So we move LEFT → j = mid - 1

*   We keep updating answer whenever we are in right rotated part.

*   This works because:
        - Left part is always fully sorted and larger
        - Right part always contains the minimum
        - We always shrink towards the pivot region

*   Time Complexity:
        O(log n)

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
