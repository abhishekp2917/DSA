Intution to add two number represented by LinkedList

*   create a node viz ansHead which will be the head of the additon of the two given LinkedList and assign a 
    pointer to it let say pointer 'curr'.

*   reverse both the given LinkedList so that we can start adding nodes value from the ones place.   

*   create two another pointers viz ptr1 and ptr2 which will intially point to that given LinkedList
    create two variables viz sum and carry in which sum will hold sum of ptr1, ptr2 and carry while 
    carry will hold carry generated after performing summation of ptr1, ptr2 and carry.

*   while ptr1 is not null or ptr2 is not null or carry is not equal to zero, add ptr1 node data is not null, 
    ptr2 node data if not null and carry and assign the result to varaible sum

*   create a new node with value equal to sum%10 (ones place digit value) and make curr pointer next 
    point to this newly created node and then move curr pointer forward.

*   assign carry value equal to sum/10

*   reverse newly created LinkedList with ansHead beign the head of it

*   finally return ansHead's next node
