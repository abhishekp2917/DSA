*   In BST left node is always smaller or equal to parent node while right node 
    is always larger or equal to parent node.

*   Since, we are looking for the smallest node, we have to move as left as possible. 

*   If the head of the tree is null then return -1, else move left. 

*   Once there is no left node of the current node exists, return the current node 
    as it is the leftest in th tree
