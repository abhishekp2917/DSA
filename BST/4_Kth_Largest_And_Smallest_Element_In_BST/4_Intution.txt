Kth Largest

*   If we will traverse tree in right -> root -> left fashion then we will encounter node in decreasing order

*   while traversing, keep track of count of node that is visited by decrementing it on each node visit and once it become equal to 1,
    assign that node value to some ref variable cause that node will be the kth largest element

Kth Smallest 

*   To find the kth smallest element, traverse the tree in left -> root -> right fashion while keeping the rest of the
    logic same.
