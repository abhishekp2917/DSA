*   declare a global variable which will track whether tree is balanced or not. Intially
    it will be set to true and will be changed only if tree is not balanced

*   declare a function which will return max height of the tree and will check whether 
    tree is balanced or not. This function will finalize the value of the global variable.

*   In that function, if root is null then return 0 as without head, the tree height will be 0

*   Move left and right to get the maximum height of both the subtree. 

*   check whether the absolute diff of left and right is greater than 1 or not. If it is,
    then set the global variable as false as tree isn't balanced one.

*   atlast return max of left and right plus 1 (plus 1 to include root node in subtree height)
