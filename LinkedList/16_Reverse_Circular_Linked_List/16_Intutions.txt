Intution to reverse a circular linked list (CLL)

*   create a variable viz tail to store head of the CLL which will become tail to the reversed CLL.

*   reverse the CLL in same fashion as we use to do with non CLL. The only difference will be that
    instead of null as reference to stop the loop we will use head of CLL. In this way, it will 
    convert CLL into reversed normal LL and will return head of the reverse LL

*   now to make this normal reversed LL into reversed CLL, make tail next node point to head 

*   finally return head
