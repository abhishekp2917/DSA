*   We need to find any cell (r, c) such that:
        mat[r][c] > all 4 neighbors

*   Brute force scanning all cells costs O(n*m), which is too slow.

*   Key idea:
        Apply Binary Search on COLUMNS to reduce one dimension.

*   Observation:
        In any chosen column,
        a peak (if exists) must lie at the MAXIMUM element of that column.

    Reason:
        Only the maximum element can be greater than its vertical neighbors.

*   Binary search strategy:

        - Pick a middle column
        - Find the row where this column has its maximum value
        - Compare this cell with its LEFT and RIGHT neighbors only

*   Why only left and right comparison is enough:

        - Up and down neighbors are already smaller
          because this is the maximum in the column

        - So only horizontal neighbors matter

*   Decision logic:

        (1) If curr > left AND curr > right:
               This cell is greater than all 4 neighbors
               → we found a valid peak

        (2) If curr < left:
               There is a larger value on the LEFT side
               → a peak MUST exist in the LEFT half
               → move search left

        (3) Else (curr < right):
               There is a larger value on the RIGHT side
               → a peak MUST exist in the RIGHT half
               → move search right

*   Why a peak must exist on the chosen side:

        Moving in the direction of a larger neighbor guarantees
        that we are climbing uphill, and every uphill path must
        eventually reach a peak.

*   This works because:
        - One direction always contains a strictly larger neighbor
        - Binary search always discards half the columns
        - A peak is guaranteed to exist in the matrix

*   Time Complexity:
        Each step:
            scan one column → O(n)
        Binary search on columns → O(log m)

        Total → O(n log m)

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
