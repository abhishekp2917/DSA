*   This problem is a variation of the Elimination Game (Josephus problem), where
    players are removed one by one in a circular order.

*   In each round, the k-th player is eliminated, and the game continues from the
    player immediately after the eliminated one.

*   The players are arranged in a circle, so after the last player we come back
    to the first one again.

*   This means the sequence repeats forever:
        1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 ...

*   After elimination, the remaining players form a smaller rotated circle of size n - 1,
    starting from the next position.

*   For example, if player 4 is removed:
        Original: 1 2 3 4 5
        Remaining: 5 1 2 3

*   The recursive call finds the winner in this smaller, rotated circle.

*   Since this smaller circle is rotated (transformed), we need to convert the result 
    of this smaller circle, back to the original circle.

*   To convert, we shift it by the same amount:
        nextStart = (k % n) + 1

*   The final mapping uses modular arithmetic to handle wrap-around:
        original_position = (nextStart + winner - 2) % n + 1

*   This same transformation idea appears in the Elimination Game, where each
    round reduces the problem size and applies a fixed position shift.

*   Since the problem size reduces by one each round, the overall time complexity
    is O(n).
