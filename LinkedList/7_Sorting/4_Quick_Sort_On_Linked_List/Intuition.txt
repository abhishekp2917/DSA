*   choose a pivot node let say head of LL.

*   segregate LL into three LL viz LL1, LL2 and LL2 in which one LL1 will have nodes value less than pivot value, LL2
    will have ndoes value equal to pivot value and LL3 will be having nodes with greater than pivot value.

*   after segregating the LL, recursively call the method to segregate LL1 and LL3 around the pivot
    (head of the LL). This recursive calling of the method by passing LL1 and then LL3 will return 
    sorted LL1 and LL3.

*   replace LL1 and LL3 with the returned value of the method which was recursively called.

*   connect LL1, LL2 and LL3 in the order of of their numbering as LL1 and LL3 will be sorted 
    after recursive calls and will have nodes smaller and greater than LL2 respectively.

*   finally return the head of the LL1.
