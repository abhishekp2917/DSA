*   Bob and Alice compete over 12 scoring sections, each worth its index value
    in points.

*   Bob can earn points for a section only if he shoots more arrows than Alice
    in that section.

*   For each score i, Bob has a binary decision: either contest that score or
    skip it entirely.

*   If Bob contests score i, he must spend aliceArrows[i] + 1 arrows to win
    i points.

*   This creates a backtracking problem where choices are made over score
    indices, not over arrows directly.

*   The recursion processes scores from highest to lowest to prioritize higher
    point values.

*   At each step, Bob’s remaining arrows and total score define the current
    state.

*   Whenever a better total score is found, the current arrow distribution is
    saved as the best result.

*   Any remaining arrows that are not used for scoring must be assigned to
    score 0, since it does not affect the total score.

*   The recursion explores all valid ways Bob can spend his arrows to maximize
    points.

*   This is a combination-style backtracking problem with an optimization goal,
    not a permutation or subset problem.

*   The time complexity is exponential due to exploring all score combinations,
    but the state space is small (12 scores).
