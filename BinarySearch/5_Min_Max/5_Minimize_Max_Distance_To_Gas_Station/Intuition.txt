*   We want to add at most k new stations such that
    the MAXIMUM distance between adjacent stations is minimized.

*   Brute force placement is impossible because positions are continuous.

*   Key observation:
        If a maximum distance D is possible,
        then any larger distance is also possible.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (distance).

*   Binary search range:
        Minimum distance = 0
        Maximum distance = very large (given by constraints)

*   For a candidate distance D:
        We check if we can make ALL adjacent gaps <= D
        using at most k new stations.

*   Feasibility logic for one gap:

        gap = stations[i+1] - stations[i]

        To make each segment <= D,
        we need to split the gap into pieces of length at most D.

        Number of new stations needed =
                floor(gap / D)

    Reason:
        Each new station creates an additional segment,
        reducing the maximum segment length.

*   For all gaps:
        - Compute required stations
        - Subtract from k
        - If k becomes negative → not feasible

*   Binary search decisions:

        - If feasible:
              distance works → try smaller distance

        - If not feasible:
              distance too small → try larger distance

*   We stop when the distance range becomes very small (precision threshold).

*   This works because:
        - Required stations decreases monotonically as distance increases
        - Feasibility is monotonic over distance

*   Time Complexity:
        For each binary search step:
            scan all gaps → O(n)
        Binary search iterations on doubles → ~60 (constant)

        Total → O(n)

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
