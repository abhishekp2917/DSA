*   The goal is to swap the kth node from the beginning
    with the kth node from the end in a singly linked list.

*   The kth node from the beginning can be found by simply
    moving k-1 steps from the head.

*   Finding the kth node from the end efficiently requires
    the two-pointer technique.

*   A fast pointer is moved k-1 steps ahead first.

*   Then both fast and slow pointers move together until
    fast reaches the last node.

*   At that moment, the slow pointer is exactly at the
    kth node from the end.

*   This works because the distance between fast and slow
    remains constant throughout the traversal.

*   Once both target nodes are identified, their values
    are swapped instead of changing links, which keeps
    the structure of the list intact.

*   This approach completes the task in one traversal
    and uses constant extra space.
