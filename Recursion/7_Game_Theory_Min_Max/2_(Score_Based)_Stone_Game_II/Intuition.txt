*   The game is played by two players taking turns.

*   On each turn, a player can take X piles from the front, where
    1 ≤ X ≤ 2*M.

*   After a player takes X piles, the value of M becomes max(M, X).

*   The key difficulty is that the allowed move range changes dynamically
    based on previous choices.

*   To handle this, we define a recursive function that represents:
    "How many stones can the current player collect starting from index `start`
     when the current M value is `m`?"

*   A suffix sum array is used so that we always know how many stones are
    still available from a given index.

*   For each possible choice of X, the current player takes some piles,
    and the opponent then plays optimally on the remaining piles.

*   Since the total stones from `start` is fixed, the current player's
    stones equal:
        total remaining stones - opponent's best achievable stones

*   This transforms the problem into choosing X such that the opponent's
    future gain is minimized.

*   Memoization ensures that each (start, M) state is solved only once,
    reducing the time complexity drastically.

*   The recursion explores all valid choices of X and picks the best one,
    ensuring optimal play.
