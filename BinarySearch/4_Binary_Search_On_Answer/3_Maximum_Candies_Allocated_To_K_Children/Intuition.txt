*   We are given piles of candies and k children.
    Each child must receive the SAME number of candies.
    We want to MAXIMIZE this number.

*   Brute force trying all distributions is impossible.

*   Key observation:
        If each child can receive X candies,
        then any smaller value is also possible.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (candies per child).

*   Binary search range:

        Minimum = 0
        Reason:
            If not enough candies, answer is 0

        Maximum = max(candies)
        Reason:
            A child cannot receive more than the largest pile

*   For a candidate value X:
        Count how many children can be served:

        For each pile with size p:
            number of children from this pile = floor(p / X)

    Total children served = sum over all piles of floor(p / X)

*   Feasibility check:

        - If total children served >= k:
              X is feasible → try larger X

        - If total children served < k:
              X is too large → try smaller X

*   Binary search goal:
        Find the LARGEST X such that
        at least k children can each receive X candies.

*   This works because:
        - Number of children served decreases monotonically as X increases
        - Integer division correctly models splitting piles into equal portions

*   Time Complexity:
        Each feasibility check   → O(n)
        Binary search steps      → O(log(maxPile))

        Total → O(n log(maxPile))

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
