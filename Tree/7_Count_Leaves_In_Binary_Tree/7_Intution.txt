*   traverse both side of the tree and check if that node has left or right node.

*   if current node has left or right node, then move to that node. If there is no child node,
    then just return 1

*   sum up the count of leave node from either side of current node and return it

*   if head is null, then return 0 as there will be no leave node (since, there is no node)
