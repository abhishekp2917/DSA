Intution to add node in the middle of the LinkedList 

*   create two pointer viz. slow and fast which intially points to head and head' next node.

*   move forward slow pointer by one node and fast pointer by two node. We are doing this because 
    when the fast pointer point to the last node, slow pointer will be pointing to the previous 
    node of middle node

*   move both the pointers until fast pointer's next next is not null

*   if fast pointer next node is not null that means there is odd number of nodes in LinkedList. So, 
    we need to move slow pointer one more time 

*   at last just add new node in middle of slow and slow's next node.
