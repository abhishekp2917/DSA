*   The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the
    previous two numbers in the sequence.

*   The values fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1 act as base cases and stop further
    recursion.

*   For any n greater than 1, fib(n) cannot be computed directly and must be
    broken into smaller subproblems.

*   According to the definition, fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2).

*   The function recursively computes these two values, reducing the problem
    size at each call.

*   Recursive calls continue until all paths reach the base cases.

*   Once base values are returned, the recursion unwinds and results are added
    together.

*   This approach directly mirrors the mathematical definition of Fibonacci.

*   However, the same values are recomputed many times, making the solution
    inefficient.

*   The time complexity is exponential, roughly O(2^n), with a recursion depth
    of O(n).
