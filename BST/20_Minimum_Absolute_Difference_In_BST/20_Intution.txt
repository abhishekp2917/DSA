*   for a particular node, it's abs diff with any other node will be minimum if and only if that other node is
    closest to the node. It could be either predecessor or sccessor. 

*   if we will traverse tree in inorder fashion than we will encounter nodes in ordered fashion. So for any node, to find the 
    min abs diff we just have to compare curr min abs diff with the diff of current node and its closest node that would be its 
    predecessor or successor.
