*   if root is null then return from that function. This will be the 
    base condition.
    
*   if root is not null, then move to the left by recursively calling the function 

*   after returning from left, recursively call the function to move right

*   at last, after returning from left and right node, add the root node data

*   logic : left --> right --> root
