*   The graph is undirected and may contain multiple connected components.

*   A cycle exists if during DFS we reach a node that has already been visited
    and is not the immediate parent.

*   The parent check is essential because in an undirected graph,
    every edge appears in both directions.

*   Without tracking the parent, simply revisiting the parent node
    would be incorrectly detected as a cycle.

*   DFS is started from every unvisited node to ensure all components
    of the graph are checked.

*   Once a cycle is found in any component, the final result is true.

*   If all components are explored without encountering such a condition,
    the graph does not contain a cycle.
