*   Two linked lists may have different lengths but can share a common tail.

*   The goal is to find the first node where both lists merge.

*   Using two pointers allows us to traverse both lists without
    explicitly calculating their lengths.

*   Each pointer starts at the head of a different list.

*   When a pointer reaches the end of its list, it is redirected
    to the head of the other list.

*   This ensures that both pointers traverse the same total distance:
    length(list1) + length(list2).

*   If the lists intersect, both pointers will arrive at the
    intersection node at the same time.

*   If the lists do not intersect, both pointers will eventually
    reach null at the same time.

*   This approach works in linear time and constant space.
