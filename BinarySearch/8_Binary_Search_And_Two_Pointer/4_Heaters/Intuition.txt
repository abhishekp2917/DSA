*   We need to find the MINIMUM radius such that every house
    is within distance 'radius' from at least one heater.

*   Instead of guessing which heater covers which house,
    we binary search on the ANSWER (radius).

*   Observation:
        If a certain radius R can cover all houses,
        then any radius greater than R will also work.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the answer.

*   We sort both houses and heaters so that we can greedily
    match houses to heaters in increasing order.

*   Binary search range:
        - Minimum radius = 0
        - Maximum radius = very large (safe upper bound)

*   For a candidate radius mid:
        We check if all houses can be covered using heaters
        with this radius.

*   Feasibility check (isPoss):

        - Use two pointers:
              i → current house
              j → current heater

        - For each house, move heater pointer forward until
          we find a heater whose coverage range includes this house:
                heater[j] - range <= house <= heater[j] + range

        - If such a heater is found, the house is covered → move to next house.

        - If we exhaust all heaters before covering all houses,
          then this radius is NOT sufficient.

*   If all houses are covered, radius is valid and we try to minimize it.
    If not, radius is too small and must be increased.

*   This works because:
        - Coverage feasibility is monotonic with radius
        - Once radius works, all larger radii will also work

*   Time Complexity:
        Sorting houses   → O(n log n)
        Sorting heaters  → O(m log m)
        Each feasibility check → O(n + m)
        Binary search steps    → O(log answer)

        Total → O((n + m) log maxRadius)

*   Space Complexity : O(1) extra space
