*   The problem asks whether matchsticks can be partitioned into exactly four
    groups such that all groups have the same total length.

*   Since each matchstick must be used exactly once, this is a partitioning
    problem rather than a combination or subset generation problem.

*   The total length of all matchsticks must be divisible by four; otherwise,
    forming a square is impossible.

*   The goal is to assign each matchstick to one of four sides without exceeding
    the required side length.

*   Backtracking is used to try all possible assignments of matchsticks to sides.

*   Sorting matchsticks in ascending order allows us to assign larger sticks
    first, which helps prune invalid paths early.

*   At each step, the current matchstick is tried on all four sides.

*   If adding the stick exceeds the expected side length, that option is skipped.

*   When all matchsticks are assigned, we check whether all four sides are equal.

*   The recursion explores all valid assignments and stops early if a valid
    square configuration is found.

*   The time complexity is exponential due to the number of assignments, but
    pruning makes the solution practical.

*   The space complexity is O(n), due to recursion depth and side-length tracking.
