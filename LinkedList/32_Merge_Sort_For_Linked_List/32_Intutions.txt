Intution for merge sort on Linked List

*   split the LL from the middle and continue splitting that splitted LL from the middle by
    recursively calling the method until LL will left with only one node.

    if LL has only one node then just return the head of the LL.

*   as we are recursively calling the same method two times by passing first and second half of the 
    LL separately, both the method will return sorted LL.

*   merge that two sorted LL into one sorted LL and then return the head of that merged LL.
