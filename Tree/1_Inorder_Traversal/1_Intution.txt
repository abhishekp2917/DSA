Approach 1 :

*   if root is null then return from that function. This will be the 
    base condition.
    
*   if root is not null, then move to the left by recursively calling the function 

*   after returning from left, add the root node data

*   at last, recursively call the function to move right

*   logic : left --> root --> right

Approach 2 :

*   keep adding left child of current root and make root point to left child. do 
    this until left child is not null

*   keep poping the element whose right child is null and add it to the result list

*   if there is a node which has right child, then add that node to the result list and
    make root point to it and repeat the process from first step
