*   The problem asks for the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of
    numbers in the array.

*   The Hamming distance between two numbers depends on how many bit positions
    differ between them.

*   Instead of comparing every pair directly, each bit position can be
    analyzed independently.

*   For a fixed bit position, pairs contribute to the Hamming distance only
    when one number has the bit set and the other does not.

*   While scanning the array from left to right, we keep track of how many
    numbers have had this bit set so far.

*   When the current number has a 0 at this bit position, it forms differing
    pairs with all previously seen numbers that had a 1.

*   When the current number has a 1 at this bit position, it forms differing
    pairs with all previously seen numbers that had a 0.

*   The number of such pairs can be computed incrementally without storing
    all previous values.

*   By adding these contributions while iterating, we account for all pairs
    exactly once.

*   This process is repeated independently for all 32 bit positions.

*   Summing contributions across all bit positions gives the total Hamming
    distance.

*   This avoids the need for nested pair comparisons across the entire array.

*   The algorithm runs in O(32 * n) time, which is effectively linear.

*   The space complexity is O(1), since only counters are used.
