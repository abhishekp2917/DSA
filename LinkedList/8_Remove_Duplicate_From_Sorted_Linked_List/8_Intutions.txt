Intution to remove duplicate element from LinkedList 

*   create two pointer viz curr and next which will point to head and head's next node of 
    LinkedList respectively.

*   while next pointer is not pointing to null, if curr pointer data is equal to next pointer data
    then remove next pointer node by making curr pointer next to point to next pointer next node else
    just move curr pointer forward by making to point to next pointer.

    in this way we are moving next pointer moving forwad until next pointer and curr pointer data 
    is not equal. once next and curr pointer is not having same data, make curr pointer next to point 
    to next pointer.

*   atlast make next pointer point to curr pointer next node.
