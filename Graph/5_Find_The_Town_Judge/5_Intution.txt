*   We need to identify a person in the town who satisfies two conditions:

        - Doesnâ€™t trust anyone.
        - Is trusted by everyone else.

*   This concludes two important observations:

        - If there are N people, the judge must be trusted by exactly N-1 people (everyone except themselves).
        - If a person trusts someone, they cannot be the judge.

*   Keeping above two observation in mind, while iterating through the trust relationships, we need to track two things:

        - Maintain a "trusted by" count of how many people trust each person.
        - Keep a set of people who trust at least one person. This helps us eliminate candidates who cannot be the judge.

*   After processing all trust relationships, check if there exists a person who is not in the set of "trusters" and 
    who has a "trusted by" count equal to N-1.

*   If such a person exists, they are the judge. If no one satisfies both conditions, there is no judge.
