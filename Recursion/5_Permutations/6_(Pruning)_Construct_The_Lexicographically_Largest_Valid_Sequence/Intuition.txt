*   The problem asks us to construct a sequence of length (2n - 1) with strict
    placement constraints on each number.

*   Each number i > 1 must appear exactly twice, and the distance between the
    two occurrences must be exactly i.

*   The number 1 appears only once.

*   All positions in the sequence must be filled, and no number can be reused.

*   The sequence must be lexicographically largest, so larger numbers should
    be placed as early as possible.

*   Backtracking is used to try placing numbers at the earliest empty position.

*   At each step, numbers are tried from n down to 1 to enforce lexicographic
    ordering.

*   If a number i > 1 is chosen, both required positions are filled together.

*   Invalid placements are pruned early when positions are out of bounds or
    already occupied.

*   Once all positions are filled, a valid sequence is obtained.
