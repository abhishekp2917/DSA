Intution to reverse a Linked List in K groups

*   create a counter having intial value of zero.

*   perform algorithm to reverse a LinkedList (using prev, curr and next pointer) until counter is 
    not less than K (do increment the counter in each iteration).

*   once counter is equal to K, LL of K nodes will be reversed in which prev will point to reversed LL
    head, head will point to reversed LL tailand next will point to head of the remaing nodes of LL.

*   if next pointer is null, then just return prev pointer node as it points to head of the reversed
    LL in K groups.

*   if next is not null, that means there are nodes remaining to be reversed in K groups, so recursively
    call the same method with next pointer being the head which will return head of the remaining 
    LL reversed in K groups. So just make head's next node point ot returned value from the recursive call
    as head points to tail of the previous section of reversed LL in K groups.

*   this recursive call of method will eventually reverse the LL in K groups and will return head of the 
    LL
