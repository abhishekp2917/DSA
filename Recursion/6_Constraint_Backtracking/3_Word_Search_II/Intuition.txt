*   The problem asks us to find which given words can be formed by walking
    paths on a character grid.

*   A word is formed by moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
    without revisiting the same cell.

*   The algorithm starts a DFS from every cell on the board.

*   A string is built character by character as the path grows.

*   Prefix pruning is used to stop exploring paths that cannot form
    any valid word.

*   A visited matrix ensures that each cell is used at most once per path.

*   When a complete word is formed, it is recorded and removed to avoid
    duplicates.

*   Backtracking restores the board state after each recursive call.

*   This approach avoids unnecessary exploration and efficiently finds
    all valid words.
