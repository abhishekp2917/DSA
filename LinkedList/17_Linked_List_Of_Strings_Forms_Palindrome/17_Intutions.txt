Intution to check if LinkedList of strings is palindrome or not

*   create two string variables viz str1 and str2 to store string value from LinkedList so 
    that we can compare it later.

*   convert LinkedList into string and assign it to str1.

*   now reverse the str1 and assign it to str2. 

*   compare str1 and str2 whether both are equal or not. if equal then LinkedList is palindrome 
    else not.
