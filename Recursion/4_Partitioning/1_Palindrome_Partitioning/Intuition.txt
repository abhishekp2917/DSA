*   The problem asks us to split a string into substrings such that every
    substring is a palindrome.

*   The order of characters is fixed; we are only deciding where to cut the
    string.

*   At each position, we try all possible prefixes starting from that index.

*   If a prefix is a palindrome, it becomes a valid part of the current
    partition.

*   After choosing a palindrome substring, we recursively solve the problem
    for the remaining suffix.

*   When the start index reaches the end of the string, a complete valid
    partition has been formed.

*   Backtracking is used to explore all valid cut combinations.

*   The palindrome check ensures that invalid substrings are never included.

*   This approach systematically explores all ways to partition the string
    into palindromic pieces.

*   The time complexity is exponential due to the number of possible partitions.

*   The space complexity is O(n) for the recursion stack and current partition.
