*   While traversing tree, if the root node value is smaller than both the target node, then explore right subtree 
    and if node value is larger than both the target node then explore left subtree else just stop exploration

*   In this process, keep adding the node value into the stack. All these node value will be ancestors of both the target node.

*   Once we get the list of ancestors, just get the pth ancestor if present else return -1
