*   We need to distribute all products into exactly n stores such that
    the MAXIMUM number of products in any store is minimized.

*   Brute force trying all distributions is impossible.

*   Key observation:
        If a maximum per-store capacity X is feasible,
        then any larger capacity is also feasible.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (capacity).

*   Binary search range:

        Minimum capacity = 1
        Reason:
            Each product must go to some store.

        Maximum capacity = max value in quantities
        Reason:
            One store might take all of a product type.

*   For a candidate capacity X:
        We compute how many stores are REQUIRED if
        no store can take more than X items.

*   For each product type with quantity q:

        We need:
            ceil(q / X) stores

        Reason:
            Each store can take at most X items,
            so we split the quantity into chunks of size ≤ X.

*   Total required stores =
        sum over all product types of ceil(quantity / X)

*   Feasibility check:
        If required stores <= n → X is valid
        Else → X is too small

*   Binary search decisions:

        - If feasible:
              store X and try smaller capacity

        - If not feasible:
              try larger capacity

*   This works because:
        - Required store count decreases monotonically as X increases
        - Ceiling division correctly models splitting across stores

*   Time Complexity:
        For each binary search step:
            scan quantities → O(m)
        Binary search steps → O(log(maxQuantity))

        Total → O(m log(maxQuantity))

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
