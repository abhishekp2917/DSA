*   Each person is represented as a node in a graph.

*   A dislike between two people creates an undirected edge,
    meaning they cannot be placed in the same group.

*   The goal is to check whether the graph can be split into
    exactly two groups such that no edge connects nodes
    within the same group.

*   This is done by assigning each node one of two values
    (+1 or -1), representing the two groups.

*   When we assign a node to a group, all of its neighbors
    must be assigned to the opposite group.

*   DFS is used to propagate this assignment through the graph.

*   If during traversal we encounter a node that has already
    been assigned a conflicting value, the graph is not bipartite.

*   Since the graph may be disconnected, we repeat this process
    for every unvisited node.

*   If all components can be assigned without conflict,
    the bipartition is possible.
