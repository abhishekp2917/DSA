*   The goal is to swap every adjacent pair of nodes in the linked list.

*   Instead of swapping data, the problem requires rearranging the links
    between nodes.

*   Each iteration focuses on exactly two nodes (a pair).

*   The second node of the pair is moved ahead of the first node,
    effectively reversing their order.

*   A `prev` pointer is used to connect the previously processed part
    of the list with the newly swapped pair.

*   After swapping a pair, the algorithm moves forward to the next
    pair using stored references.

*   Special care is taken to handle cases where the list has an odd
    number of nodes.

*   The process continues until no more complete pairs remain.

*   The head of the list changes after the first swap, so it is
    stored separately and returned at the end.
