Intution for insertion Sort on Linked List

*   create a Node viz tempHead whose next will be head.

*   create pointers curr which will point to head.

*   while curr is not pointing to null, create another pointer which will always start from tempHead.
    Move pointer ptr forward until either ptr's data is greater than curr data or ptr point to curr.

*   once we find the node which is greater than curr poiinter data, add curr node between ptr and ptr's 
    prev node and move curr pointer forward.

*   finally return tempHead next node.
