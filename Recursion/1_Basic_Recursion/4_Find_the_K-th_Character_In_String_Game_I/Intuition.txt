*   The string in this problem is not built explicitly but follows a recursive
    construction pattern.

*   At each level, the string is divided into two halves of equal length.

*   The first half remains unchanged, while the second half is formed by taking
    the first half and shifting each character forward by one.

*   This creates a self-similar structure, where smaller versions of the string
    appear inside larger ones.

*   To find the k-th character, we only need to know whether k lies in the first
    half or the second half.

*   If k is in the first half, the answer is the same as the k-th character of
    the smaller string.

*   If k is in the second half, it maps to position (k - n/2) in the first half.

*   After finding the corresponding character in the first half, it is shifted
    by +1 to match the transformation rule.

*   This process repeats recursively until k becomes 1, which directly maps to
    the base character 'a'.

*   The problem size halves at each step, so the recursion depth is logarithmic.

*   The time complexity is O(log n), and the space complexity is O(log n) due to
    recursion.
