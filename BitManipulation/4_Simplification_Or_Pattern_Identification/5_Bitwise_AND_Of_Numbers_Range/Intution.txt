*   The problem asks us to compute the bitwise AND of all integers in the range
    from left to right, inclusive.

*   Bitwise AND keeps a bit set only if that bit is set in every number of the
    range.

*   If left and right differ at a certain bit position, that bit will eventually
    become zero when ANDing all numbers in between.

*   This means that only the common leading bits shared by left and right can
    survive in the final result.

*   To find these common bits, both numbers are repeatedly shifted right until
    they become equal.

*   Each right shift removes one differing least significant bit from
    consideration.

*   The number of shifts performed tells us how many bits were removed.

*   Once left and right are equal, the remaining value represents the common
    prefix.

*   Shifting this common prefix back to the left restores it to its original
    bit position.

*   All lower bits become zero because they differed at some point in the range.

*   This approach avoids iterating through every number in the range.

*   The algorithm runs in O(number of bits) time.

*   The space complexity is O(1), since only a few integer variables are used.
