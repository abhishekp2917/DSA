*   The array is sorted and every number appears exactly twice except one number.
    This strongly hints at using Binary Search instead of linear scanning.

*   In a perfect paired array (without the single element):
        pairs start at EVEN indices:
        (0,1), (2,3), (4,5), ...

*   When the single element appears, this pairing pattern breaks:
        - Before the single element → pairs start at EVEN indices
        - After the single element  → pairs start at ODD indices

*   So the position (parity) of pair indices tells us which side the single element lies on.

*   At each step, we pick a middle index and compare it with its neighbors.

*   If nums[mid] is different from both neighbors,
    then it is not part of any pair → this is the single element.

*   Otherwise, nums[mid] belongs to a pair.
    We determine the index of the second element of that pair:
        - If left == nums[mid], the pair ends at mid
        - Else, the pair ends at mid + 1

*   If the pair ends at an EVEN index,
    it means we are still on the LEFT side of the single element,
    so we discard the right half.

*   If the pair ends at an ODD index,
    it means we are on the RIGHT side of the single element,
    so we discard the left half.

*   This works because the pairing index pattern changes exactly at the single element.

*   Time Complexity  : O(log n) because we use binary search.

*   Space Complexity : O(1) because no extra data structures are used.
