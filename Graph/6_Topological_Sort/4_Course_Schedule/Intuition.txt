*   Each course is a node in a directed graph.

*   A prerequisite pair [a, b] means course b must be completed
    before course a, creating a directed edge b → a.

*   A course can be taken only when all its prerequisites
    have already been completed.

*   The idea is to repeatedly take courses that currently
    have no prerequisites left.

*   We first compute how many prerequisites (indegree) each course has.

*   All courses with indegree 0 can be taken immediately,
    so they are added to a queue.

*   When a course is taken, it effectively removes itself
    as a prerequisite for other courses.

*   This is simulated by reducing the indegree of its neighboring courses.

*   If any neighbor’s indegree becomes 0, it means all its
    prerequisites are now satisfied, and it can be taken next.

*   We keep processing courses this way until no more are available.

*   If we are able to process all courses, there is no cycle,
    and finishing all courses is possible.

*   If some courses remain unprocessed, it means there is a cycle,
    making it impossible to finish all courses.
