*   The problem asks for the minimum cost required to satisfy a list of item
    needs using individual prices and special bundle offers.

*   At any point, the state of the problem is fully described by the remaining
    needs.

*   For a given needs state, we have two choices:
    buy all remaining items individually, or apply a valid special offer.

*   Applying an offer reduces the current needs and incurs the offer’s price.

*   This naturally leads to a recursive exploration of all valid ways to apply
    offers.

*   The same needs configuration can be reached through different sequences of
    offers.

*   To avoid recomputing results for the same needs, memoization is used.

*   Each recursive call computes the minimum cost for a specific needs state.

*   The recursion ends when no offer can be applied, and only individual
    purchases remain.

*   The final answer is the minimum cost computed for the initial needs.

*   The state space is limited by the maximum quantities in needs, making
    DFS with memoization efficient.

*   This problem is a combination-style optimization problem with state
    compression.
