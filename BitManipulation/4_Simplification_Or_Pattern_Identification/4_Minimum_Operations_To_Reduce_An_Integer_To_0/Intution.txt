*   The problem asks for the minimum number of operations required to reduce a
    given integer n to zero.

*   The allowed operations effectively depend on the binary representation of
    the number.

*   Observing the least significant bits helps determine the optimal operation
    at each step.

*   If the number is even, dividing it by two is always beneficial.

*   If the number is odd, one operation is required to handle the least
    significant bit.

*   When the last two bits are both set (binary pattern ...11), incrementing the
    number causes a carry that clears multiple bits at once.

*   This greedy increment is often better than decrementing, as it reduces the
    total number of operations.

*   After handling odd cases, the number is shifted right, effectively dividing
    it by two.

*   Each shift represents a step toward reducing the number to zero.

*   The process repeats until the value becomes zero.

*   Each decision is made using constant-time bit operations.

*   The algorithm runs in O(number of bits in n) time.

*   The space complexity is O(1), since only a few variables are used.
