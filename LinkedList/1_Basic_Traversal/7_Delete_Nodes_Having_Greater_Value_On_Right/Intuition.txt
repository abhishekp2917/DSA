*   first reverse the LL so that we have to remove all the nodes which are smaller than current node
    as performing this is equal to removing node which has node greater on right.

*   after reversing, create a pointer prev and curr where prev will point to head and curr will point to 
    head's next node.

*   while curr is not pointing to null, move curr pointer forward until curr pointer data is greater than 
    prev pointer data.

*   once curr data is greater than prev data, make prev's next pointer point to curr. Then make prev point
    to curr and curr point to curr's next node.

*   after coming out of the loop, reverse the LL once again and return the head of that LL.
