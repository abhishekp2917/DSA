*   The problem asks us to find a value k that can be used to sort a permutation
    using the allowed bitwise operations.

*   If the permutation is already sorted, no operation is required, and the
    answer should be zero.

*   Only the elements that are not in their correct positions affect the
    required value of k.

*   Elements that are already at index i do not need to be moved and therefore
    do not impose any constraint.

*   For all misplaced elements, k must satisfy the condition imposed by their
    values.

*   Since the operation involves bitwise AND, all constraints can be combined
    using a cumulative AND operation.

*   Initializing k with all bits set allows the first AND operation to correctly
    capture the first constraint.

*   As we AND k with each misplaced value, bits that are not common to all such
    values are cleared.

*   The remaining bits in k represent the maximum flexibility allowed while
    still being able to sort the permutation.

*   If no elements are misplaced, k remains unchanged, and the correct return
    value is zero.

*   Otherwise, the final value of k represents the required answer.

*   The algorithm processes the array in a single pass.

*   The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the permutation.

*   The space complexity is O(1), since only a few integer variables are used.
