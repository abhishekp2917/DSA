*   create three tempNodes viz zeroes, ones and twos which will be the head of the LinkedList of 0s,
    1s and 2s respectively.

*   create four pointers viz zero, one, two and curr which will point to zeroes, ones, twos and head
    of the given LinkedList.

*   move curr pointer forward and if curr data is equal to zero than add that node to zeroes
    LinkedList by removing it from the given LinkedList, else if curr data is equal to one than add
    that node to ones LinkedList by removing it from the given LinkedList, else add that node to twos
    LinkedList by removing it from the given LinkedList.

*   in this way segregate the given LinkedList into three different LinkedList of 0's, 1's and 2's.

*   atlast connect all the three LinkedList in oreder of zeroes, ones and twos and return zeroes next node.
