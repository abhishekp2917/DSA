*   The algorithm aims to maximize the count of leaf nodes visited within a given budget k, where the cost of visiting a 
    leaf node is equal to its level in the binary tree. To achieve this, we use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal approach. 


*   We begin at the root of the binary tree (level 1) and initialize a counter for the number of leaf nodes visited.

*   We use a BFS traversal to explore the tree level by level. This ensures that we visit leaf nodes at a lower level 
    before those at higher levels, as the cost of visiting a leaf node is equal to its level.

*   At each level of the BFS traversal, we check if the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left and right children). 
    If it is a leaf node, we calculate the cost of visiting it, which is equal to its level.

*   We compare the cost of visiting the leaf node with the remaining budget (k). If the cost is less than or equal to the 
    remaining budget, we visit the leaf node, decrement the budget by the cost, and increment the leaf node counter. If 
    the cost exceeds the remaining budget, we break out of the loop, as we cannot visit this leaf node or any subsequent 
    leaf nodes at higher levels due to the cost constraint.

*   Regardless of whether we visit a leaf node or not, we continue the BFS traversal by enqueuing any non-leaf children 
    nodes with their corresponding levels.

*   We repeat the above steps until we have traversed the entire tree or exhausted the budget.
