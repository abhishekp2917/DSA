*   We want to arrive as LATE as possible such that:
        - Our arrival time is not already taken by any passenger
        - We can still board some bus with available capacity

*   Observation:
        If arriving at time T is possible,
        then arriving at any earlier time is also possible.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (arrival time).

*   We sort both buses and passengers so that we can simulate boarding
    in chronological order using two pointers.

*   We store all passenger times in a HashSet because:
        - We are NOT allowed to arrive at a time already taken by a passenger
        - We need fast O(1) checking for occupied times

*   Binary search range:
        - Minimum arrival time = 1
        - Maximum arrival time = last bus departure time

*   For a candidate mid time:
        - First, move backward from mid to find the nearest FREE time
          (not present in passenger set)

        - Then check if arriving at this time allows us to catch any bus

*   Feasibility check (isPoss):

        - Simulate boarding bus by bus
        - For each bus, board passengers in order until:
              capacity is full OR
              passenger arrives after bus departs

        - Two possible ways we can board:
              (1) If we arrive before some passenger → we take their spot
              (2) If bus still has capacity and we arrive before departure

*   If any bus can take us, this arrival time is feasible.

*   If feasible:
        - Store it as an answer
        - Try to move RIGHT to find a later valid time

*   If not feasible:
        - Move LEFT because time is too late

*   This works because:
        - Feasibility is monotonic with arrival time
        - Once a time fails, all later times will also fail

*   Time Complexity:
        Sorting buses + passengers  → O(n log n + m log m)
        Binary search steps         → O(log maxTime)
        Each feasibility check     → O(n + m)

        Total → O((n + m) log maxTime)

*   Space Complexity :
        O(m) for HashSet to store passenger times
