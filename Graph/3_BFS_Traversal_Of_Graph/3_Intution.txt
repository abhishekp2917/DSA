BFS Traversal of a Graph:

*   Begin from a starting point, like exploring a neighborhood from your house.

*   Check out first all the places (nodes) directly connected to your starting point before moving further.

*   Keep a list (queue) of places to visit in the order they’re discovered, so you don’t miss anything.

*   Keep track of places you’ve already visited, so you don’t revisit the same spot.

*   Once all the nearby places are visited, move to the next level of connections by exploring neighbours of the
    node present in the queue and repeat the process.

*   Finish when no more places to visit i.e. queue is empty.
