Intution to construct LinkedList matrix from 2D array

*   create a Node type 2D array of size m+1 and n+1 where m and n are rows and column size of
    given 2D array.

*   intialize Node type 2D array with nodes with data corespond to row and column of given 2D array. 

*   now make right and below pointer of each node of the 2D array to point to its next column node and 
    next row node. In this way, it will connect all the nodes of 2D array

*   atlast return zeroth row and zeroth column node as it will be the head of the LinkedList matrix.
