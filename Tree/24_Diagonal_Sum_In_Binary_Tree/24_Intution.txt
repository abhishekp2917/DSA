*   The intution is to keep track of horizontal and vertical position of each node let's say
    using var 'x' and 'y' respectively. The initial value of both of them should be 0. 

*   If we take absolute diff of both 'x' and 'y' and divide the result by 2, we will get the 
    diagonal level of a particular node.

*   Since we get the level of each node, use map to add the node value of each level and later on
    after completion of traversal, transfer it to the list
