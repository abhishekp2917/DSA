Question Link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-loop-in-linked-list/1

*   using slow and fast pointer detect if loop is present or not. If fast pointer becomes null 
    that means loop is not present. If slow and fast pointer points to same node after some iteration
    then loop is present.

*   if loop is present then find out number of nodes present in the loop viz N by moving 
    fast pointer one node ahead of slow node and then moving fast node forward until fast and 
    slow becomes equal.

*   now make slow and fast pointer point to head of LinkedList and move fast pointer ahead by 
    N-1 nodes. We are doing this because let say there are M nodes after which there is loop of N nodes
    then if we move N nodes from head then ((N+M)-N)=M nodes will remain to reach at node where tail
    of LL connected to (intersection point). 

    once fast pointer will move to that point, then pointer at head (slow) and at fast will be at 
    M distance from the intersection point which we can find out by movinf both slow and fast pointer
    ahead by one node at a time until they both point to same node.

*   at last once both the fast and slow pointer meet at same point, make fast prev node's next point 
    to null
