*   Instantiate the array of size greater than or equal to the maximum number of push calls
    so that all the pushed element can be accomodated in the array.

*   maintain couple of variable to keep track of front and rear element of the queue

*   for every push call, add the element in the array at rear index and then increment the rear index by 1

*   for every pop call, if front and rear pointer points to same index, then return -1 as it means queue
    is empty. If front != rear, then return element at front index and increment front by 1 which will be 
    similar to removing front element
