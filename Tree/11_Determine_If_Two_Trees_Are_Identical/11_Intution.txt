*   traverse left and right sub tree parallelly for both the trees and check if 
    the nodes are same or not. If condition fails then return false.

*   At last return AND logic of result returned from left and right subtree traversal

*   Here we are doing AND operation cause if any of the subtree isn't identical then,
    operation of left and right will be false as well.
