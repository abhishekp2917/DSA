*   A subarray is considered beautiful if the XOR of all its elements is 0.

*   Directly checking all subarrays would be inefficient.

*   XOR over a range can be represented using prefix XOR.

*   Let prefixXor[i] be the XOR of elements from index 0 to i.

*   If prefixXor[i] == prefixXor[j],
    then the XOR of elements between (i, j] is 0.

*   This means every pair of equal prefix XOR values
    forms one or more beautiful subarrays.

*   As we iterate through the array, we keep track of
    how many times each prefix XOR value has appeared.

*   When the current prefix XOR has appeared before,
    it contributes that many beautiful subarrays ending
    at the current index.

*   We accumulate this count as we move forward.

*   Initializing prefix XOR 0 with frequency 1 handles
    subarrays starting from index 0.

*   The al*
