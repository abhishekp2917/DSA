*   The problem asks us to generate a sequence of Gray codes for a given number
    of bits, where consecutive values differ by exactly one bit.

*   A direct observation is that there are exactly 2^n distinct Gray codes for
    n bits.

*   Instead of constructing the sequence recursively, we can use a known
    mathematical relationship between binary numbers and Gray codes.

*   For any integer i, its Gray code representation can be obtained by
    XORing i with i right-shifted by one bit.

*   This transformation ensures that consecutive integers differ in only one
    bit in their Gray code representations.

*   The sequence is generated by iterating through all integers from 0 to
    2^n - 1 and applying this transformation.

*   Each computed value is added to the result list in order.

*   The first Gray code is always 0, which satisfies the requirement.

*   This method guarantees that all generated codes are unique.

*   It also ensures that each consecutive pair of codes differs by exactly one
    bit.

*   The approach avoids recursion and keeps the implementation simple.

*   The time complexity is O(2^n), since each Gray code is generated once.

*   The space complexity is O(2^n), required to store the full sequence.
