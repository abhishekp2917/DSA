Approach 1 :

*   The idea is to iteratively traverse the tree, and when you encounter the first leaf node, store 
    its level in result variable
    
*   Now whenever you encounter any leaf node, compare its level with previously stored result

*   If they are the same then proceed for the rest of tree, else return false.

Approach 2 :

*   The intuition behind this approach lies in the understanding that if all leaf nodes in a binary tree are at the same 
    level, the maximum depth and minimum depth of the tree should be equal

*   So find the min and max depth of the tree and return true if both are the same else return false
