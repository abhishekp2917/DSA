*   create a helper function which calculates sum of all the nodes which are at K distance from 
    root node

*   traverse the tree and check for the target node. if we the target node is not in the current subtree
    return 0

*   once we found the target node, call the helper function to calculate the sum and then return K 

*   while backtracking, if we get the positive value from left or right subtree, then it shows the target
    node is in the subtree which returned positive value. So call the helper function to add the sum of nodes
    of other subtree i.e if we get +ve value from left subtree, call the helper function for right subtree
    or viceversa

*   return one subtracted value if we get +ve value from the child (subtree) else return 0
