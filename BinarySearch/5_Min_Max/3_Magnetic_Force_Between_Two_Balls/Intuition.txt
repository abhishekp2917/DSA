*   We need to place m balls in given positions such that
    the MINIMUM distance between any two balls is maximized.

*   Brute force trying all placements is impossible.

*   Key observation:
        If a minimum distance D is feasible,
        then any smaller distance is also feasible.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (distance).

*   We sort the positions because:
        - Distance comparisons only make sense in sorted order
        - Greedy left-to-right placement becomes optimal

*   Binary search range:
        Minimum distance = 0
        Maximum distance = max(position) - min(position)

*   For a candidate distance D:
        We check if we can place m balls such that
        every adjacent pair has distance >= D.

*   Greedy placement logic:

        - Place first ball at the leftmost position
        - For each next position:
              if distance from last placed ball >= D,
              place a new ball here

    Reason:
        Placing as early as possible leaves more room
        for future balls and maximizes the chance of placing all m balls.

*   Feasibility check:
        If we can place at least m balls → D is valid
        Else → D is too large

*   Binary search decisions:

        - If feasible:
              store D and try larger distance

        - If not feasible:
              try smaller distance

*   This works because:
        - As D increases, number of placeable balls decreases monotonically
        - Greedy placement gives maximum possible placements for a fixed D

*   Time Complexity:
        Sorting                  → O(n log n)
        Each feasibility check   → O(n)
        Binary search steps      → O(log(maxDistance))

        Total → O(n log n)

*   Space Complexity:
        O(1)
