*   The problem asks us to choose two palindromic subsequences that do not
    share any character indices.

*   Each character in the string can either be included in a subsequence
    or skipped, which naturally forms a subset decision.

*   A bitmask is used to represent which indices are included in a subsequence.

*   All possible subsequences are generated using recursion by making a
    take or skip decision at each index.

*   Whenever a generated subsequence is a palindrome, its length is stored
    against its bitmask.

*   After generating all palindromic subsequences, every pair of bitmasks
    is compared.

*   If two bitmasks do not overlap, the corresponding subsequences do not
    share any characters.

*   The product of their lengths is computed and the maximum product is tracked.

*   This approach works because the string length is small, allowing
    enumeration of all subsets.

*   The solution combines subset enumeration with bitmasking and validation.
