*   The problem asks whether one course is a prerequisite of another,
    considering both direct and indirect dependencies.

*   Since course dependencies form a directed acyclic graph,
    courses can be processed in topological order.

*   The key idea is to precompute all prerequisite relationships
    before answering queries.

*   A boolean matrix is used where matrix[u][v] means
    "u is a prerequisite of v".

*   Initially, each course is marked as a prerequisite of itself.

*   Courses with no prerequisites are processed first.

*   When a course is processed, its prerequisite information is
    propagated to all courses that depend on it.

*   This propagation ensures that indirect prerequisites are captured.

*   By the time a course is processed, all of its prerequisites
    have already been finalized.

*   Once preprocessing is complete, each query can be answered
    in constant time by simply checking the matrix.
