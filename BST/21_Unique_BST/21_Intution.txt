*   Let's say we have N = 4, that means there are 4 nodes in a BST.

*   In this case below are the possible combinations 

    (1)  
            root
             \
              \
              3 Nodes

        Here root will be the smallest element having 0 element on left and 3 on right
        So, number of BST with this combination will be equal to 
        (Num of combo of BST with 0 element) * (Num of combo of BST with 3 elements)

    (2)  
           root
           / \
          /   \
      1 Node  2 Nodes

        number of BST with this combination will be equal to 
        (Num of combo of BST with 1 element) * (Num of combo of BST with 2 elements)

    (3)  
           root
           / \
          /   \
      2 Nodes  1 Node

        number of BST with this combination will be equal to 
        (Num of combo of BST with 2 elements) * (Num of combo of BST with 1 elements)

    (4)  
           root
           / 
          /   
      3 Nodes

        number of BST with this combination will be equal to 
        (Num of combo of BST with 3 elements) * (Num of combo of BST with 0 elements)

    Finally, total combo of BST with 4 nodes will be equal to sum of above combinations count.

*   keeping above obervation in mind, we can say that for a value N, 

                                N-1
                                ____
    possible comination of N =  \      (possible comination of i) * (possible comination of N-i-1) 
                                /___
                                 i=0
