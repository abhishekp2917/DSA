*   The intution is to keep two pointer, one will point to smallest node of first BST and other will point to greatest of second one

*   we will add both the pointers value and will compare with the target. We will traverse both the BST in inorder fashion. In which, second traversal will 
    be done in reverse order so that initially second will traverse from greatest to smallest.

*   If result is larger than the target, then make the second pointer point to smaller than the current value by traversing second BST.

*   If result is smaller than the target, then make the first pointer point to larger than the current value by traversing first BST.

*   In case it matches the target, increment te count by 1 and move both the pointer.
