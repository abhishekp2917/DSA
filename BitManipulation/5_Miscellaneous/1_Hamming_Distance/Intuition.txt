*   The Hamming distance between two numbers is defined as the number of bit
    positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

*   To identify differing bit positions, the two numbers are XORed together.

*   In the XOR result, a bit is set to 1 if and only if the bits at that position
    in the two original numbers are different.

*   Therefore, the problem reduces to counting how many set bits exist in the
    XOR result.

*   Instead of checking each bit individually, a faster method is used to count
    the set bits.

*   The expression xor & (xor - 1) removes the lowest set bit from the number.

*   Each time this operation is applied, exactly one differing bit is removed.

*   By repeating this operation until the number becomes zero, we count all the
    set bits efficiently.

*   The counter is incremented once per removed bit, which directly corresponds
    to one differing bit position.

*   This approach is known as Brian Kernighan’s algorithm.

*   The loop runs once for each set bit in the XOR value, not for every bit
    position.

*   This makes the solution efficient, especially when the number of differing
    bits is small.

*   The time complexity is O(number of set bits in x ^ y).

*   The space complexity is O(1), since only a few integer variables are used.
