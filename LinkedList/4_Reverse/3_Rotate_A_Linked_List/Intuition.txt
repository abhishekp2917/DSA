Question Link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-a-linked-list/1

*   create two pointer prev and curr which will be pointing to null and head intially.

*   move both the pointer by K node so that curr pointer will reach to that node from where all
    the nodes after curr pointer inclusively will come before head of LL after rotation

    if curr is pointing to null that means we have rotated the LL K times where here K is equal to
    size of LL. In thsi case LL will remain as it is so just return head of LL

*   if curr is not null the make prev pointer next point to null to break the link between prev
    curr pointer

*   find the last node of the second part (list starting from curr pointer) of LL and make last node
    next point to head to make second part come before head of LL.

*   finally return curr pointer which is head of the second part.
