*   We need the LARGEST possible square side length such that:
        sum of the square <= threshold

*   Brute force trying all square sizes and all positions would be too slow.

*   Key observation:
        If a square of side length L is possible,
        then any smaller side length is also possible.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on the ANSWER (side length).

*   Binary search range:
        Minimum side = 1
        Maximum side = min(rows, cols)

*   For a fixed side length:
        We need to check if ANY square of this size has sum <= threshold.

*   To compute square sums efficiently:
        We build a 2D prefix sum matrix where:
            prefixSum[r][c] = sum of rectangle (0,0) → (r-1,c-1)

    Reason:
        Without prefix sums, each square sum costs O(k^2)
        With prefix sums, each square sum costs O(1)

*   Square sum formula using prefix sum:

        squareSum =
            prefix[br][bc]
          - prefix[br - side][bc]
          - prefix[br][bc - side]
          + prefix[br - side][bc - side]

    Reason:
        Inclusion-exclusion removes double counted regions.

*   Feasibility check:
        Slide the square over all valid bottom-right positions
        and stop as soon as one valid square is found.

*   Binary search decisions:

        - If any square of this size is valid:
              size works → try bigger size

        - Else:
              size too big → try smaller size

*   This works because:
        - Feasibility is monotonic with side length
        - Prefix sums allow constant-time square sum queries

*   Time Complexity:
        Prefix sum build              → O(rows * cols)
        For each binary search step:
            scanning all squares      → O(rows * cols)
        Binary search steps           → O(log(min(rows, cols)))

        Total → O(rows * cols * log(min(rows, cols)))

*   Space Complexity:
        Prefix sum matrix → O(rows * cols)
