*   This problem is a variation of Combination Sum, but instead of forming sums
    equal to a target, we are distributing values across fixed buckets.

*   Each cookie bag must be assigned to exactly one child, which creates a
    choice at every step.

*   The order of cookie bags is fixed, but each bag can be given to any child,
    similar to choosing where to place a number.

*   This naturally leads to a backtracking approach where we try all possible
    assignments.

*   Instead of collecting combinations, the objective is to minimize the
    maximum load across all children.

*   While distributing cookies, we keep track of the current maximum cookies
    received by any child.

*   Once all cookies are assigned, this maximum value represents the unfairness
    of that distribution.

*   Among all possible distributions, we select the one with the minimum
    unfairness.

*   This is similar to Combination Sum in structure, but differs in goal:
    Combination Sum checks feasibility, while this problem optimizes a value.

*   The recursion explores all assignments and uses backtracking to undo choices.

*   The time complexity is exponential due to all possible distributions.

*   The space complexity is O(k), from the distribution array and recursion stack.
