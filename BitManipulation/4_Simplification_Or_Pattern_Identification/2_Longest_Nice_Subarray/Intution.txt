*   The problem asks for the length of the longest subarray where no two numbers
    share any common set bit.

*   Two numbers are considered incompatible if their bitwise AND is non-zero.

*   This condition suggests using a sliding window to maintain a valid subarray.

*   A variable is used to store the bitwise OR of all numbers currently inside
    the window.

*   When a new number is added, we check if it shares any set bit with the
    current window by computing (nums[end] & or).

*   If a conflict is found, the window is shrunk from the left until the
    conflict is resolved.

*   While shrinking the window, the leftmost number is removed by XORing it
    from the OR value.

*   This works because the window maintains the invariant that no two numbers
    share a common set bit.

*   Once the window becomes valid, the new number is added to the OR value.

*   The length of the current valid window is computed and compared with the
    maximum length found so far.

*   The process continues until all elements are processed.

*   Each element enters and leaves the window at most once.

*   This guarantees linear time complexity.

*   The algorithm runs in O(n) time.

*   The space complexity is O(1), since only a few integer variables are used.
