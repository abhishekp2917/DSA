*   The problem asks us to fill a partially completed 9x9 Sudoku board
    such that all Sudoku rules are satisfied.

*   Each empty cell must contain a digit from 1 to 9.

*   The order of filling matters because an early wrong choice can
    invalidate later placements.

*   The algorithm first collects all empty cell positions.

*   Backtracking is used to fill these empty cells one by one.

*   For each empty cell, we try all digits from 1 to 9.

*   A digit is placed only if it does not violate row, column,
    or 3x3 sub-grid constraints.

*   If a conflict arises later, the algorithm backtracks and
    tries a different digit.

*   When all empty cells are filled successfully, the Sudoku
    board is solved.

*   Pruning happens naturally by rejecting invalid placements early.
