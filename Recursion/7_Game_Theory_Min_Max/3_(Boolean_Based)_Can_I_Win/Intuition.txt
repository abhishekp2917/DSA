*   Two players take turns picking a unique number from 1 to maxChoosableInteger.

*   Each picked number is added to a running total.

*   The player who causes the total to reach or exceed desiredTotal wins.

*   The game is fully deterministic: both players play optimally.

*   The key idea is to simulate the game state using recursion.

*   A game state is completely defined by:
    - which numbers are still available
    - how much more total is needed to win

*   A bitmask is used to represent available numbers efficiently.

*   For each available number, the current player tries picking it.

*   After picking a number, the opponent becomes the current player
    in the next recursive call.

*   If there exists at least one move that forces the opponent into
    a losing position, the current player wins.

*   Memoization is crucial because many game states repeat due to
    different move orders leading to the same set of remaining numbers.

*   The recursion answers one question:
    "Can the current player force a win from this exact state?"

*   The initial call answers whether the first player can force a win.
