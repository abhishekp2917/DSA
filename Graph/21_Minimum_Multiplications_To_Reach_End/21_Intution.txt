*   We are given a start number which can be multipled with any number from the array of number given any number of time.

*   The bruteforce approach would be to explore all the combinations of numbers for multiplication to check if that 
    combination can lead us to end number.

*   But this would lead to TLE since we can use a number from array any number of times.

*   One thing to worth notice is after each multiplication we are asked to apply modulo with 100000. This means any combination
    of number we take for multiplication, the resultant number would always be in the range of [0, 99999].

*   These finite range of number can be treated as graph nodes in which edges between nodes would be determined by the multiplication
    factor which could be any number from the array given. 

*   Now we have a graph structure, we can simply apply Dijkstra algorithm to get the minimum number of steps from start to end. 
    We would explore that node first which has minimum step count from start number/node.
