*   The problem asks for all possible results obtained by adding parentheses
    in different ways to an arithmetic expression.

*   Parentheses decide the order of evaluation, which means choosing where
    to split the expression.

*   Each operator can be treated as a split point that divides the expression
    into a left and a right sub-expression.

*   For a chosen split, all possible results of the left part are combined
    with all possible results of the right part.

*   This naturally leads to a divide-and-conquer recursive solution.

*   The base case occurs when the sub-expression contains only one number.

*   Since the same sub-expression ranges appear repeatedly, memoization is
    used to avoid recomputation.

*   Each recursive call returns a list of all possible results for a given
    sub-expression range.

*   The final answer is the list of all results obtained from splitting the
    full expression in every valid way.

*   This approach ensures all parenthesization possibilities are explored.

*   The time complexity is exponential in the number of operators, but
    memoization significantly reduces repeated work.
