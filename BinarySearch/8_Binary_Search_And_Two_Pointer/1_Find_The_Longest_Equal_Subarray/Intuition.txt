*   We need the maximum length of a subarray such that after deleting
    at most k elements, all remaining elements are equal.

*   Key observation:
        In a valid window:
            window_length - frequency_of_most_common_element <= k

    Because all other elements must be deleted.

*   Instead of directly finding the answer,
    we binary search on the ANSWER (possible length of equal subarray).

*   Observation for binary search:
        If a length L is possible,
        then any smaller length is also possible.

    This monotonic behavior allows Binary Search on length.

*   Binary search range:
        Minimum length = 1
        Maximum length = nums.size()

*   For a candidate size = mid:
        We check if there exists ANY subarray where:
            - Some number appears at least 'mid' times
            - Total window length <= mid + k
              (so at most k deletions are needed)

*   Feasibility check using Sliding Window:

        - Maintain a window [i ... j]
        - Maintain frequency of numbers using HashMap

        - For each j:
              increase frequency of nums[j]

        - If any number’s frequency >= mid:
              then we can delete the remaining elements
              and form an equal subarray of size mid → return true

        - If window size becomes >= mid + k:
              shrink from the left to maintain deletion limit

*   If any valid window is found, mid is feasible.
    Otherwise, mid is too large.

*   If feasible:
        - Store mid as answer
        - Try larger size

*   If not feasible:
        - Try smaller size

*   This works because:
        - Validity depends only on window length and frequency
        - Feasibility is monotonic with respect to subarray size

*   Time Complexity:
        Binary search steps        → O(log n)
        Each feasibility check    → Sliding window O(n)

        Total → O(n log n)

*   Space Complexity:
        HashMap for frequencies → O(n) in worst case
