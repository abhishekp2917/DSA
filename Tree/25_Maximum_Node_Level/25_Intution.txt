*   As we have to find the level which has most number of nodes, we have to perform level order 
    traversal. Use queue for this purpose.

*   Use variable to keep track of max number of nodes and level which has that number of nodes.

*   For each level, store the current size of queue so that while poping out the elements from
    it and adding back their child nodes into it, we could know how many elements we have to
    remove in current iteration.

*   Use a level counter to keep track of level and increament it's value in each iteration.
