*   Since we havce been given sorted array, if we keep the mid of array the root value, then
    all the elements to it left ill be part of left subtree and all to its right will be part of right subtree
    as in BST all elements of left subtree is smaller than root and vice versa for right subtree.

*   for an array, find its mid and assign it to answer array and recursively find mid for its left part and right 
    part. Continue this untill all the elements get inserted into answer array.

*   we are inserting mid value first because requirement is to give preorder traversa. 

*   since we need to provide lexicographically smallest preorder, in case array size is even for a particular recursive 
    call, consider the floor value as a mid value cause that will be the smaller than mid ceil value
