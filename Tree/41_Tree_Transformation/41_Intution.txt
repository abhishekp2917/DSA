*   to form the star, there should be only one intermidiary node 

*   this intermidiary node can be removed by merging it with adjacent node (which 
    is asked in question)

*   so first count the number of intermidiary nodes that includes root node also

*   if root node has only one child than intermidiary node count will reduce by 1

*   atlast return (count of intermidiary node - 1). cause by removing this number 
    of intermidiary node, we will have only one such node to form star
